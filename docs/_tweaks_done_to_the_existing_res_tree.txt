 STUFF IN THE RESOURCE TREE I'VE HAD TO TWEAK IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS THING WORK
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *MODULE SYSTEM
 -rather new animation format, changed flags, a list with a lot of new hardcoded entries, work done primarly by GetAssista.
 -different opcode correlation, operations need to be remapped on build, as some of them don't *mean* the same between WB and MB.
 -we may avoid changing much else by specifying we aren't compatible with WB by *not* using a directive in <module.ini>,
  then the game enters in soft-compatibility shim mode instead of showing hard errors.
  
 *MODULE INI
 -set to *not* compatible with warband, this is important, specially when parsing brfs and skeletons
 -disable multiplayer and tutorial, show performance warnings which may come in handy later on
 
 *BINARY RESOURCE FILES
 -the imposed limitation of more than two characters in names. specially troubling when a mesh called "0" is used for invisible items.
 -even sharing the same resource loader and parser than the original game, seems like Warband's new physics engine doesn't likes
  some of the collision bodies in TLD. the solution is to comment them out first in scene_props.txt/placeholders and fix them later on,
  one by one, once we're in-game.
 -interface changes, need to add a lot of meshes to <user_interface_b.brf>, Taleworlds should have been smarter and put it aside in the
  brand-new <user_interface_c.brf> which includes multiplayer thingies.
  
 *SHADERS
 -completely incompatible, manage to launch the game first using placeholders and recode
  them later on using the sources provided by TaleWorlds.
 -we don't need iron launcher, replacement or work-arounds at all, big selling point.
 
 *MODULE DATA
 -mostly compatible, primarily the font xml and agent body definitions, stuff like the flora need to be accomodated to the new format.
 
 *TEXT FILES
 -use the thankfully commented <game_variables.txt> from Warband, which includes all the new colors and positions for UI thingies. mostly a shameless copy-paste.
 
 
 THOUGHTS
 --------
 
 Taleworlds wanted to make mods inter-compatible at first but got tired, burn-out or short
 of time to finish this task leaving a halfplemented frankestein-esque thing which helps us in our task.
