    Merlkir - concept artist, main 2D artists, texturer, very rarely a 3D modeler, custom animations, lore sage and overall a proper wanker. Did some voice acting too. The movie too.
    Marco Tarini (mtarini) - coding wizard, voodoo master, mage, author of OpenBRF (made expressly for this mod!), all the shader magic is only possible thanks to him. Also the custom races. Attacking wargs, oliphants, orcs, uruks, trolls, windy flora and waving banners...all work properly because of him. A shining talent and an expert in the field. Also: lotsa coding, map art (including map writings), animations, and a bit of rigging and modelling (like most animated map icons)...
