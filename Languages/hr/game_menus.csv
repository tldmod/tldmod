It is like nothing you have ever seen.^^ Bregalad -- or Quickbeam, as you know him -- comes striding by, and pauses only to say, '{playername}! Ware!

Quickly, you take his advice and hasten away from Orthanc.^^ At about midnight, Isengard begins to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. You cannot help but shiver as you see smoke and steam rising in great pillars, and a great coil of vapour rising and snaking around the Tower, until it resembles a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and moonlit above.
