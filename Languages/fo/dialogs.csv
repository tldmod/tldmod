; dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
; dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
; dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
; dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk|You still haven't finished the last task I gave you, {playername}. You should be working on that, not asking me for other things to do.
; dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.1|I don't have any other task for you right now.
; dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_capture_troll_1|You are a brave servant, {playername}, and we will give you a glimpse of our plans. We need fresh monstrous blood and flesh. We need it to twist it and bend it and torture it and tame it and reshape it and breed it, to forge and strengthen our own breeds of colossal warriors!
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_1:lord_mission_capture_troll_2|How can I serve, Master?
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_2:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|A wild cave troll, {playername}. Capture one strong exemplar for me and bring it to me, alive. We need one more of them for Our experiments! Two, would be better. The more we have, the better.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa|Where can such a beast be found?
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infob|How can such a beast be captured?
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc|How can such a beast be transported to you?
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted|You shall have your wild troll, Master.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected|Mercy, Master! That beast will smash me like a bug!
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|In these time of blood and shadows, wild cave trolls are growing excited and they are spreading from their lairs in the Misty Mountains... the best place where to look would be around the caves there.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infob:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You shall find one, and take it down in combat. Fear not of killing it during the fight: a troll is too coriaceous a beast for your weapons to kill it right away... and they do recover, more than you would expect. After it falls over its own black blood, you shall carry it to our feet, still breathing.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You will be provided with a robust wheeled cage. It harbours more than enough space for a troll, and it can be pulled around. Hasten your steps on the way back: not even the metal of the cage is totally safe against the fury of a troll blinded by rage and pain. Make sure it does not break free and kill you.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected:lord_pretalk|Only now you reveal what you are really worth, but I knew that of you all along. Weak, coward {playername}. Now begone.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted:lord_pretalk|I knew I could count on your strength and bravery. Slaves, give to {playername} one of our wheeled cages! {playername}, return when you have my gift. I want it before {reg1} dawns are passed.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_kill_troll|Our land is facing dangers that were unheard of in our times. People are disappearing in the outskirts of {s3}. Not only commoners, but even small armed groups who venture outside the walls never return. There have been the strangest rumors, but I know what we are facing.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_kill_troll:lord_mission_told|Wild trolls, {playername}. Giant beasts, twisted montrousities. They never ventured so far from their dark caves in the mountains but at least one of them have been sighted around {s3}. I don't know what witchery has caused this, but I need that thing to be dispatched.
; dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a|How can those beasts be fought?
; dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a:lord_mission_told|A troll is a dangerous creature indeed. A giant monster which possesses an incredible strength in its deformed muscles. Their skin is as hard as iron, and a tree trunk is but a small club when wielded in their hands. It is rumored that a single troll can easily best a group of half a dozen well armed and trained men, wasting each of them with a single blow. Not only men but horses too fear trolls. Be careful if you plan to charge one while mounted.
; dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b|Do you think it comes from Mordor, or Isengard?
; dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b:lord_mission_told|No, I don't think so. We have news that both the White Wizard and the Black Tower have all kinds of monsters among their ranks, but from what I hear the beast terrifying {s3} is one savage, untamed beast. Remember, there could be more than one. But you can be sure that some obscure craft from the Enemy has led this new plague upon us.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave servant like you, {playername}. The strangest rumors reach my ears from the forest of Fangorn. Minions sent to harvest wood, and even my commanders traversing the place, occasionally fail to return. Other times, they report of mysterious losses among their troops. They blame ghosts, spirits of the wood, ancient curses... Nonsense! Puny excuses for their own cowardice or ineptitude!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1|What do you command me to do about it, Master?
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|But Master, there is danger and pain in Fangorn! I've felt it myself!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2|Maybe it is just that my other servants are unable to prevent the most cowardly worms in their troops from deserting.  Fools, blinded by superstitions.   Or, maybe, it is the treacherous ambushes of elven scum, hiding in the putrid trees as they usually do.   It could even be lowborn traitors from Rohan.  Or who knows what else. I want you to find out, {playername}.
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted|I fear no elves or spirit. Leave this to me, Master.
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|Master, pity your servant! Don't ask me to venture in that cursed place!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected:lord_pretalk|So you are like the other worms: a superstitious, worthless coward.  I overestimated you. Now, begone!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good. Go there and shed some light on this matter. Then return to me and report. I expect to see you back with news before {reg1} dawns are passed.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_find_lost_spears|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave commander like you, {playername}. We are ill equipped to fight off the Rhun hordes. Our armies are losing battles one by one. A legend tells that once upon a time, there were spears made by Dwarves for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for..
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1|What do you command me to do about it, my lord?
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2|These weapons would increase the effectiveness of our armies, but above all they will lift the spirits of our men. You'll have to find these spears. You'll have to go ask the dwarves for permission to search for the spears in the deeps of the Lonely Mountain. Beware, you may encounter some orcs or trolls in the tunnels. Are you available for this task?
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_accepted|I fear no orcs nor trolls! I will find these spears for you, my lord.
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_rejected|I'm afraid I can't help you, my lord.
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_rejected:lord_pretalk|I see that discretion is the better part of your valor. Maybe you should stick to scouting duties.
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good luck then!
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer|There is an important service you can deliver to our people, {playername}.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0|My power to defend and preserve Lothlorien has been diminished by the devices of the enemy. A master sorcerer of Dol Guldur is invoking powerful charms that inhibit our defenses. Though he is a mortal, he has become one of the enemies greatest pupils in the use of arcane rituals and he represents a great threat to our people. You must hunt him down and destroy him!
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1|Where can I find the sorcerer, my Lady?
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2|Search for him in Mirkwood forest, not far from Dol Guldur itself. He is both a well guarded and a cautious foe so you will need to use stealth to prevent the alarm from being raised. If he escapes, he will relocate to other dark places that we know not of and continue his wickedness unchallenged. There will be only one opportunity to defeat him. Much depends on your success. Go with our blessings.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_pretalk|As you command, my Lady. I will try my best to eliminate this evil.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected|Forgive me, my Lady. I have some pressing matters to attend before I can help your people with this endevour.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected:lord_pretalk|I understand, {playername}. But do not tally for too long, for the effort of resisting his magic is wearying me.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is an urgent matter... My messenger is due to report on our battle plans to commanders in {s14}. His trip has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time he must get through. So, I want to at least make sure he's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort him to {s14} and make sure he arrives safe and sound.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound,and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die. This man is dear to me, {playername},but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here.I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look,{reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation.Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2:lord_mission_raise_troops_told|If you can raise {reg1} {s14} and bring them to me, that will probably be enough.
; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted|Of course, {s65}. Give me {reg1} fresh recruits and I'll train them to be {s14}.
; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate_1|I suggest another method, {s65}. I'll take {reg1} fresh recruits to the arena teach them a thing or two...
; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate_1:lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate|I suggest another method, {s65}.... I'll take {reg1} fresh recruits to the arena teach them a thing or two. They won't become {s14} afterwards, but this is one step towards that.

; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You've taken a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command. Also, I'll advance you some money to help with expenses. Here, this purse should do it. Thank you for your help.
; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate:close_window|This is an interesting proposal, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send the recruits to the arena. Follow them there, and whip them up to shape. I will be watching. Thank you for your help.
; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my bodyguards and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. There has been news recently that the fugitive has been seen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and deliver him swift justice, and I'll reward you in turn.
; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.

; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}.  I will be grateful, and of course your prowess wil be duly noted.  Well, good hunting to you.
; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|There are refugees on their way to {s6}. They will be moving slow, and as such, is a moving target to our enemies. Defend them until they reach their destination.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.3|Our spies tell us that there are refugees on their way to {s6}. They will be slow because of all the old, the sick, and the dying. Hunt them down, kill all the men, and take everyone else as slaves. Make sure none arrive at their destination!
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.4|Well, some of the slaves working in {s4} have run away.  The ungrateful swine, whose lives we spared!  From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands now, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the one who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the enemy commanders and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to question him on the enemy battle plans. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I don't want to get close to any of them.

; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_choose_mode|I'm ready for training.
; dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
; dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
; dlga_trainer_choose_mode:trainer_choose_mode_player|We have several training modes to improve our soldiers' skills.

Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.6|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}. With a pound of that iron, our smelter can make enough material to cover an entire pack of warriors.

; dlga_party_reinforce:party_reinforce_end|We haven't seen much enemy activity yet. Maybe later, thanks.
; dlga_party_reinforce:party_reinforce_end.1|We don't need any more soldiers, thank you.
; dlga_party_reinforce:party_reinforce_check|Reinforce our party? We can use a few more soldiers, but keep in mind we only accept troops of our faction.
; dlga_party_reinforce:party_reinforce_end.2|Unfortunately you don't have any {s22} soldiers to reinforce us with.

; dlga_start:close_window.31|You there! You survived? Good! You can't be waving a stick about! Take this!
; dlga_start:ori_choose_1|You fight well, kinsman! I don't know how you've been surviving so far. I remember you joining us recently, before all this... before Balin fell... Where are you from?
; dlga_ori_choose_1:ori_choose_finish|I was a tracker, sent to the woods near the Bear people. I recently heard about Balin's company and joined.
; dlga_ori_choose_1:ori_choose_finish.1|I am a distant cousin, a veteran bodyguard from a mine far away. Then I heard of Balin and joined.
; dlga_ori_choose_1:ori_choose_finish.2|I am from the Iron Hills, a veteran of the wars, and a miner during peace. I heard of Balin and joined, wanting more kill orcs.
; dlga_ori_choose_finish:close_window|Good to know! I found these, fit for your background. We shall make our stand here and take as many of them with us!
; dlga_start:close_window.32|It looks like you are shaking off those rusty skills, eh? Here, take a swig of this. It will make you feel better. More orcs are coming!
; dlga_start:close_window.33|Take that dusty thing off you and wear this. Should protect you better. These orcs bite hard!
; dlga_start:close_window.34|Something big is coming! Get ready!
; dlga_start:close_window.35|There are too many of them... but we are dwarves!
; dlga_start:close_window.36|Those orcs opened up a cavern filled with treasures. Here are some that I found, go ahead and take them.
; dlga_start:close_window.37|No.... I hear them... they are outside! They are everywhere!
; dlga_start:close_window.38|Here... Our Lord Balin's... you are worthy of these...
