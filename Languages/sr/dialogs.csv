My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I am the Heir of Isildur – see, here is Anduril, the Flame of the West, which I bear in battle. The Blade that was Broken shines again! It will not be long before Saruman’s forces reach these walls. I ask you now to lend me your aid and defend the Rohirrim, for the honour of the Lord of the Mark. Let this be the hour when we draw swords together!

I am Legolas of Mirkwood, and though I do not much like this place I like the approaching hordes of Saruman even less. What would I give for a hundred more of my kin here! There are too few of us, too few. We shall need your aid, Commander, though we may be but a few leaves in the forest. Come, let me show you where our bows will be of the most use…
; dlga_start:hd_defense_01.2|Right glad am I to see you, kinsman! I am Gimli, son of Gloin. It is a great host that comes now against us, but my axe is restless in my hand, and I know you feel the same! Give us a row of orc-necks to hew and room to swing, and together we shall teach them the meaning of fear. Stout feet and hard axes, that is what will carry us through the night! Ai oi! There are enough for both of us. Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!

; dlga_start:aragorn_thanks_hd|{playername}, I am glad to see you live still. The men are weary with battle, but thanks to you they see the dawn of a new day. The hillmen have given themselves up, and they shall be put to work to repair the evil which they have joined, after which I hope they will return to their own lands. They were easily deceived by Saruman, for much was taken from them, and much remains to be given back; we shall have to see what can be done for them later.
; dlga_aragorn_thanks_hd:close_window|I hope our paths may cross again, {playername}. I bid you farewell now, for I ride on an errand most urgent. With the first light of morning we must go, my friends and I, and take a dark road out of this valley. {playername}, the times are evil, but your valour gladdens the hearts of all free peoples everywhere, from the North to the South. Fight well, and we may meet again beyond the shadows!
; dlga_start:close_window.1|In a little while I take the road again, {playername}, a hard road untrodden by many for uncounted years. I hope your path is easier than mine, friend. In the meantime, perhaps you may wish to go into the deep Caverns of Helm's Deep, of which my companion Gimli the Dwarf has spoken much.

; dlga_start:close_window.5|Thank you for your help. I must say it was quite satisfying to manage those Orcs. You were of great help to us. But now, hm, we have work to do that you cannot help with. You should maybe find a safe spot outside Isengard and wait until we are finished.
; dlga_start:treebeard_isengard_3|Hello again. It is good to see you safe and dry. I must say it will take a long while to flush all of Saruman's filth away. But we’ve done quite well, hmm, yes. He will do no more harm.
; dlga_treebeard_isengard_3:close_window|Ho, hmm, I owe you great thanks. I had not expected any help from others, and it is good to learn that our Last March may not end quite so badly, after all! Since the tree-killer is dealt with, we should now be able to keep Rohan's northern marches safe, for a while.
; dlga_treebeard_isengard_3:close_window.1|Hmm? Ho, hmm… ah. So, you have come all the way from Rohan, have you? Hmm. I have heard some news from the south, yes. Good news, news to gladden all hearts. I have good will to Theoden King, and I am glad he was aided by the likes of you in his hour of peril, hmm! We have managed here well enough, and now we Ents will see to it that Saruman does not set foot beyond Isengard, without our leave. The Isen flows well again, and soon I hope the water will once more be fit to drink. Ha, hm, I feel a song coming on. A song of the old days… the old trees I knew…

dlga_start:treebeard_introduce_1|(You find that you are looking at a most extraordinary creature. He is very tall and stiff-limbed with bark-like skin and leafy hair. Moss is also covering parts of his body. But at the moment you are noting little but the eyes. The deep eyes are surveying you, slow and solemn but very sharp and penetrating. You think they are brown, shot with green light, as if there is an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking. But on the surface his eyes are sparkling with the present... like the sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or the ripples of a very deep lake.)

The creature continues to look at you and you notice the other huge tree creatures are watching you too, as if expecting you to speak...)
dlga_treebeard_introduce_2:treebeard_introduce_3|Pardon my intrusion... I'm but a weary traveler seeking refuge from recent events... my name is {playername}. Might I ask who you are?
dlga_treebeard_introduce_3:treebeard_introduce_4|(The stiff-limbed tree giant slowly opens his mouth which is concealed behind small branches, leaves and moss. With a very deep, slow and booming voice he very slowly expounds in a most commanding way:)^  'Hrooom... Hmmm... *I* am not going to tell you my name... not yet at any rate. For one thing it would take a long while. My name is growing all the time and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time saying anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.'
dlga_treebeard_introduce_4:treebeard_introduce_5|Oh, you are an Ent! Legends speak of you and I am honored to be in your presence. I do not wish to impose and will leave if you so wish.

They look at each other for another prolonged moment until an unusually hasty Ent who is resembling a rowan tree seems to want to speak. However, he stays silent until the giant stiff-limbed Ent continues:)

It is {reg1?unusual from your race:nice to speak with elves again}.} Times are not good, ever since the Entwives disappeared - and now there are many evil creatures released by the Dark Lord himself who are trying to destroy our homes. We seek someone who is fast but not hasty. Someone who can help us while we discuss our next moves.^Many bands of orcs have raided the woods and burned down our trees with fire arrows - if you were to defeat the orcs and make sure that they do not threaten the woods we would be grateful and consider you a true friend.

dlga_treebeard_about_ents:treebeard_pretalk|Hrooom... We are shepherds of the Trees and we protect them from perils. We are older than any of the mortal races but not as old as the Elves who cured us from dumbness. Things have changed over the ages. In the beginning we were more hasty and flexible. Over time many of us have been lost. Some of us are still true Ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but many are half awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, well getting Entish. That is going on all the time. When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. Still, we do what we can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.

However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.

dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my slaves, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple animals, or are you merely incompetent?

dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to capture new men to work these fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of slaves that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}.

dlga_lord_healers_injured_check:lord_pretalk|Not right now.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunters_start|My lord, I am prepared to take more arduous tasks to serve you better and end this war. What would you have me do?
dlga_ring_hunters_start:ring_hunters_check|{playername}, you have done great deeds and proven yourself worthy of the task I will now request of you. I trust you to deal with this matter as best you see fit, but know that our foe is dangerous and bloodshed will be unavoidable. Is your company strong enough for battle?
dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_1|Yes, my lord. I have a group of well-trained, battlehardened men. We are ready for anything.
dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_check_failed|I am afraid not, my lord.
dlga_ring_hunters_check_failed:lord_pretalk|Then you are not ready for this task yet,{playername}. Go and gather more troops.
; dlga_ring_hunters_1:ring_hunters_2|Excellent. The North has recently been plagued by a marauding band of outlaws who raid villages and ambush travellers, searching for rings of any kind.^^   You are to hunt these bandits down and put an end to their quest. Survivors of their last pillaging have reported two groups.^^   The first is returning with loot to their encampment on the eaves of Mirkwood. The other advances towards Beorn's House in great numbers and I fear what may happen if they are left unimpeded.
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_what|My lord, what could they be searching for?
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_accept|My lord, I will do what is necessary to stop these... 'Ring Hunters'
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_reject|I am not ready for such a task just yet.
dlga_ring_hunters_accept:close_window|With bravery in your heart and sharp steel in your hands you will, {playername}. We will await news of your success.
dlga_ring_hunters_reject:lord_pretalk|I see. Let me know when you are, but make haste, we do not want them to succeed.
dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2|Designs of the Enemy are hidden from us, but we can see thes ruffians are bent on finding what they are looking for.  I cannot reveal all that we know, for much hangs in the balance and secrecy is paramount. Whatever they seek must be a powerful weapon, one to be used to cause more destruction in the Dark Lord's name.
dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2.1|The Dark Lord previously sent emissaries to different dwarven clans, asking about the rings of power given to our people. These bandits may be looking for them, or others like them...   Whether true or not, they must not fall into the Dark Lord's hands.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_party_defeated|My lord, I come bearing ill news... Though I have defeated the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, their leaders were not there. They may have found what they were looking for
dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated:ring_hunter_party_defeated2|This is not ill news,{playername}. We have heard of your great victory! The lives of those villagers matter more to our cause than any weapon. As we speak, the Beornings are amassing their strength, invigorated by your victory.     Moreover, we don't believe that these Ring Hunters found what they are looking for. If it was the weapon we feared, then we would have felt something... a disturbance.
dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated2:ring_hunter_quest_end|I am glad, then. Whatever this weapon may have been... they may still be looking for it. I will remain vigilant and remain on the lookout for more of these Ring Hunters.
dlga_ring_hunter_quest_end:close_window|We all will. Thank you once more for your service, {playername}.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf|My lord, though I was unable to intercept the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, I was able to defeat their leaders in their lair. They had this in their possession.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf:ring_hunter_lair_defeated|I see, a ring, but not THE ring. Not even one of the great rings, yet not a mere trinket either. There is some power woven into it.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated:ring_hunter_lair_defeated2|Then we were right to snatch it from the Dark Lord’s fingers, before he could use it to spread his Shadow over the land and have it seep into the hearts of many.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated2:ring_hunter_lair_quest_end|You must keep this ring and use it to fight the Enemy and his armies. I trust you to use it well.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_quest_end:close_window|This is an honour, my Lord, thank you! My heart will stay true and my arm strong.
dlga_start:ring_hunters_party_attack|Look here, men. More lambs to the slaughter.
dlga_ring_hunters_party_attack:ring_hunters_party_attack_2|Your rampage has come to an end.
dlga_ring_hunters_party_attack_2:close_window|Check their packs and their fingers. Save one to torture. Everyone else is for eating!
dlga_start:ring_hunter_lair_defeat|That ring belongs to the Dark Lord! You can not have it!
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeat:ring_hunter_lair_defeat2|It belongs to me now.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeat2:close_window|Do you think you’ve won a great victory? A pale tattered shade of one, perhaps. Bah! Our warband marched out long before you arrived. You are too late to save those they went after!
dlga_start:beorn_message|My {lord/lady}, we received a warning from {s1} that a large outlaw warband was headed our way! Alas, there was no time to gather enough warriors. Having heard the sound of battle, we prepared for the worst!
dlga_beorn_message:beorn_message2|That was no band of ordinary outlaws. They were the Dark Lord's worst of the worst, at least here in the North. Their leaders, however, were not here. Their den lies near Mirkwood Forest and I must make haste.
dlga_beorn_message2:beorn_message_end|Yes, we were warned about the camp also and sent scouts towards it. We saw them burn it down and swiftly ride towards Mordor. If you chose to rush there first, you may not have been able to help us. We are truly grateful for your victory!
dlga_beorn_message_end:beorn_message_close|I must report back and tell {s1} about the battle. Go back to your village and dispatch scouts. There may be stragglers.
dlga_beorn_message_close:close_window|Yes, commander. We shall remain vigilant and send for more men from the distant hamlets. Your victory today has inspired us all.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_give_troops_check|Reinforce my party? I can always use a few more soldiers.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk|Unfortunately you don't have any {s14} soldiers to reinforce me with.

dlga_lord_talk:lord_get_reward_item_ask|I want to request a special item.
dlga_lord_get_reward_item_ask:lord_talk|Seems like you have no place in your inventory for anything else. Make some room, then return.
dlga_lord_get_reward_item_ask:lord_get_reward_item|Really? Remember that you need to hold a certain rank and command considerable influence to deserve special items.^What can I give you?

dlga_lord_talk:marshall_ask|I would like to have a council with you about the War.
dlga_marshall_ask:lord_pretalk|I would hardly take advice if you are merely {s25}, {playername}. I would have been more inclined to listen if you were {s24}, but you are not.

dlga_lord_mission_defend_village_b:lord_mission_defend_question|We can, but it will take time to mobilize. We fear that we may be too late when we do. ^^You and your men seem able to ride out quickly. Can you defend this village?

dlga_lord_mission_sorcerer_completed:lord_pretalk|Yes {playername}, I had sensed his death. The veil of sorcery has been lifted from the wood and much of my power has returned. You have performed a great service for our people and as such you are entitled to a gift. Take this...
dlga_lord_mission_sorcerer_failed:lord_pretalk|Yes {playername}, I sense the dark arts of enemy still pressing upon us. His efforts seem greater now. It is unfortunate that you could not stop him. No doubt he will take additional precautions in future to ward against our efforts. He will likely never be found while Dol Guldur still stands. Thank you for your efforts but leave me now. I grow tired.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_lend_companion_end|Oh, you want your companion back? I see...
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_pretalk|{playername}, I must beg your patience, I still have need of your companion. Please return later when things have settled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg1} prisoners.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank_extra|Why, I have brought you {reg2} prisoners, in case {reg1} are not enough.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.1|Indeed. I have rescued {reg1} allied prisoners and they joined my party.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.2|Indeed. I have scouted {s13}.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.3|Indeed. I have dispatched the scouts.

dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank:capture_enemy_hero_thank_2|Many thanks, my friend. He will serve very well for questioning. You've done a fine work here.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Certainly, {s65}.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing.

dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk|You still haven't finished the last task I gave you, {playername}. You should be working on that, not asking me for other things to do.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.1|I don't have any other task for you right now.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_capture_troll_1|You are a brave servant, {playername}, and we will give you a glimpse of our plans. We need fresh monstrous blood and flesh. We need it to twist it and bend it and torture it and tame it and reshape it and breed it, to forge and strengthen our own breeds of colossal warriors!
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_1:lord_mission_capture_troll_2|How can I serve, Master?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_2:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|A wild cave troll, {playername}. Capture one strong exemplar for me and bring it to me, alive. We need one more of them for Our experiments! Two, would be better. The more we have, the better.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa|Where can such a beast be found?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infob|How can such a beast be captured?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc|How can such a beast be transported to you?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted|You shall have your wild troll, Master.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected|Mercy, Master! That beast will smash me like a bug!
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|In these time of blood and shadows, wild cave trolls are growing excited and they are spreading from their lairs in the Misty Mountains... the best place where to look would be around the caves there.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infob:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You shall find one, and take it down in combat. Fear not of killing it during the fight: a troll is too coriaceous a beast for your weapons to kill it right away... and they do recover, more than you would expect. After it falls over its own black blood, you shall carry it to our feet, still breathing.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You will be provided with a robust wheeled cage. It harbours more than enough space for a troll, and it can be pulled around. Hasten your steps on the way back: not even the metal of the cage is totally safe against the fury of a troll blinded by rage and pain. Make sure it does not break free and kill you.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected:lord_pretalk|Only now you reveal what you are really worth, but I knew that of you all along. Weak, coward {playername}. Now begone.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted:lord_pretalk|I knew I could count on your strength and bravery. Slaves, give to {playername} one of our wheeled cages! {playername}, return when you have my gift. I want it before {reg1} dawns are passed.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_kill_troll|Our land is facing dangers that were unheard of in our times. People are disappearing in the outskirts of {s3}. Not only commoners, but even small armed groups who venture outside the walls never return. There have been the strangest rumors, but I know what we are facing.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_kill_troll:lord_mission_told|Wild trolls, {playername}. Giant beasts, twisted montrousities. They never ventured so far from their dark caves in the mountains but at least one of them have been sighted around {s3}. I don't know what witchery has caused this, but I need that thing to be dispatched.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a|How can those beasts be fought?
dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a:lord_mission_told|A troll is a dangerous creature indeed. A giant monster which possesses an incredible strength in its deformed muscles. Their skin is as hard as iron, and a tree trunk is but a small club when wielded in their hands. It is rumored that a single troll can easily best a group of half a dozen well armed and trained men, wasting each of them with a single blow. Not only men but horses too fear trolls. Be careful if you plan to charge one while mounted.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b|Do you think it comes from Mordor, or Isengard?
dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b:lord_mission_told|No, I don't think so. We have news that both the White Wizard and the Black Tower have all kinds of monsters among their ranks, but from what I hear the beast terrifying {s3} is one savage, untamed beast. Remember, there could be more than one. But you can be sure that some obscure craft from the Enemy has led this new plague upon us.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave servant like you, {playername}. The strangest rumors reach my ears from the forest of Fangorn. Minions sent to harvest wood, and even my commanders traversing the place, occasionally fail to return. Other times, they report of mysterious losses among their troops. They blame ghosts, spirits of the wood, ancient curses... Nonsense! Puny excuses for their own cowardice or ineptitude!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1|What do you command me to do about it, Master?
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|But Master, there is danger and pain in Fangorn! I've felt it myself!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2|Maybe it is just that my other servants are unable to prevent the most cowardly worms in their troops from deserting.  Fools, blinded by superstitions.   Or, maybe, it is the treacherous ambushes of elven scum, hiding in the putrid trees as they usually do.   It could even be lowborn traitors from Rohan.

Our armies are losing battles one by one. A legend tells that once upon a time, there were spears made by Dwarves for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for..

dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2|These weapons would increase the effectiveness of our armies, but above all they will lift the spirits of our men. You'll have to find these spears. You'll have to go ask the dwarves for permission to search for the spears in the deeps of the Lonely Mountain. Beware, you may encounter some orcs or trolls in the tunnels. Are you available for this task?

A master sorcerer of Dol Guldur is invoking powerful charms that inhibit our defenses. Though he is a mortal, he has become one of the enemies greatest pupils in the use of arcane rituals and he represents a great threat to our people. You must hunt him down and destroy him!

dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2|Search for him in Mirkwood forest, not far from Dol Guldur itself. He is both a well guarded and a cautious foe so you will need to use stealth to prevent the alarm from being raised. If he escapes, he will relocate to other dark places that we know not of and continue his wickedness unchallenged. There will be only one opportunity to defeat him. Much depends on your success. Go with our blessings.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_pretalk|As you command, my Lady. I will try my best to eliminate this evil.

dlga_start:trainer_pretalk|You have survived up to Gauntlet wave {reg2}. {s4}
dlga_start:trainer_pretalk.1|Very good, you've eliminated all the opponents.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_choose_mode|I'm ready for training.
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
dlga_trainer_choose_mode:trainer_choose_mode_player|We have several training modes to improve our soldiers' skills. Single combat will pit you against one to four opponents, in team combat your team of four will face four, eight or twelve combatants, and, finally, Gauntlet is the ultimate challenge for any warrior - you'll face waves of increasing number of opponents all by yourself. Mass melee is a simple brawl.^Which one do you prefer?

dlga_trainer_choose_opponents_player:trainer_choose_weapon.6|Twelve, me and my companions can take on anyone.
dlga_trainer_choose_opponents_player:trainer_pretalk|None, I've changed my mind.
dlga_trainer_choose_weapon:trainer_choose_weapon_player|And finally choose your preferred weapon type.
dlga_trainer_choose_weapon_player:trainer_begin_training|One-handed weapons.
dlga_trainer_choose_weapon_player:trainer_begin_training.1|Two-handed weapons.
dlga_trainer_choose_weapon_player:trainer_begin_training.2|Polearms.

dlga_mayor_mission_told_kill_quest_bandit:merchant_quest_stall|I cannot do this now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Thanks for offering to help.Actually I was looking for someone to supply us with Food.Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food|Our food supplies are dwindling and the supply trains are getting waylaid by the enemy.I need someone to bring us {reg5} units of food in {reg6} days, or we'll begin to starve.Maybe nearby friendly towns have enough for us too. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will find the food and bring it to you.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food:merchant_quest_stall|I am sorry, you'll need to find someone else for that.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|A task, you say? Actually I am looking for someone to supply us with ore and metals. Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.6|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}. With a pound of that iron, our smelter can make enough material to cover an entire pack of warriors.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron|We need {reg5} units of {s6} in {reg6} days, before our weaponsmiths run out of raw materials. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will get the metal scraps and bring them to you.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron:merchant_quest_stall|I am too busy to deal with that.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.7|Thanks for offering to help. Actually I was looking for someone to escort a supply train. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a supply train to {s8}. However with all those enemy patrols out there, I don't want to send them without an extra escort. A group at least {reg4} would offer them adequate protection. Can you lead that supply train to {s8} in 7 days?^^[you will earn {reg14} Resource Points of {s14}]
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the supply train.

dlga_merchant_caravan_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.8|Actually, I was looking for an able commander like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome goblins. They have infested the neighbourhood and are preying on supply trains and stray warriors. They have avoided all our patrols up to now. If someone doesn't stop them soon, I would need to request serious military action...

They've been ambushing and robbing drunken recruits under the cover of night, and then fading away quick as lightning when the guards finally show up. We've not been able to catch a one of them. They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win. That seems to be the only way of getting rid of them. Are you up to the task?
