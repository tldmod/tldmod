The region is sparsely dotted with small farmsteads and vineyards with low stone walls and you pass the occasional stilted cottage tucked away in the reeds.^^The peaceful motion of the raft helps you drift off to sleep...

It is like nothing you have ever seen.^^ Bregalad -- or Quickbeam, as you know him -- comes striding by, and pauses only to say, '{playername}! Ware! Keep away from the Tower -- we shall soon break the dam and bring the Isen into this valley, for a little while. You will find it very hard to stay standing here, I think!' Quickly, you take his advice and hasten away from Orthanc.^^ At about midnight, Isengard begins to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. You cannot help but shiver as you see smoke and steam rising in great pillars, and a great coil of vapour rising and snaking around the Tower, until it resembles a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and moonlit above. The wrath of the Ents is slow, but possesses an irresistible force...
