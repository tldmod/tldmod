str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save.

str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern blagging drinks from indulgent patrons by regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.
str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you for ever and ever.
str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time your growing tavern becomes a popular feasthall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.
str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.
str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord. Occasionally your liege calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.
str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive holdings and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your liege lord's kingdom. With intrigue to busy yourself with, your own forests to hunt, a hall to feast in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.
str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your liege lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, joining the major nobility of the realm. Soon you complete your investitute as baron of {s7}, and you become one of your liege's close advisors and adjutants. Your renown garners you much subtle pull and influence as well as overt political power. Now you spend your days playing the games of power, administering your great fiefs, and recounting the old times of adventure and glory.
str_retirement_text_10|Though you started from humble beginnings, your liege lord holds you in high esteem, and a ripple of shock passes through the realm when he names you to the hereditary title of {count/countess} of {s9}. Vast fiefs and fortunes are now yours to rule. You quickly become your liege's most trusted advisor, almost his equal and charged with much of the running of his realm, and you sit a throne in your own splendourous palace as one of the most powerful figures in Calradia.

str_npc2_intro_response_1|My business is Gondor's business, and who are you?
str_npc3_intro_response_1|And a good day to you too, is there something amiss?
str_npc4_intro_response_1|Greetings, my Lady. With whom do I have the honour to speak?
str_npc5_intro_response_1|Hail Elf-lord! It's a great honour to meet you.
str_npc6_intro_response_1|Is this how the Silvan Elves greet their guests?
str_npc7_intro_response_1|{playername} at your service. How fare the Durin's folk?
str_npc8_intro_response_1|Greetings. I was wondering if there are any volunteers here to join us in our travels.
str_npc9_intro_response_1|Hold your threats, Uruk, before it comes to blows - I am not a snitch.
str_npc10_intro_response_1|Who are you?
str_npc11_intro_response_1|Who are you?
str_npc12_intro_response_1|Who are you?
str_npc13_intro_response_1|Who are you?
str_npc14_intro_response_1|Who are you?
str_npc15_intro_response_1|Praise the Eye, Snaga. What's your story?
str_npc16_intro_response_1|Who are you?
str_npc17_intro_response_1|Mirkwood is a magnificent forest. Who are you? Do you know much about the woods?
str_npc1_intro_response_2|Never mind, I fear caves do not make a pleasant place for conversation.
str_npc2_intro_response_2|Never mind, I don't have time to speak to guards.
str_npc3_intro_response_2|Never mind, I'll make 'racket' elsewhere.
str_npc4_intro_response_2|Excuse me, I have urgent matters elsewhere.
str_npc5_intro_response_2|Excuse me, I have less important people to talk to.
str_npc6_intro_response_2|The feeling is mutual. Goodbye.
str_npc7_intro_response_2|Never mind, I need some fresh air.
str_npc8_intro_response_2|Never mind, we are merely sight-seeing.
str_npc9_intro_response_2|I'll just be on my way then, or my sword arm will start to itch.
str_npc10_intro_response_2|[Ignore and leave]
str_npc11_intro_response_2|Mind your business, maggot!
str_npc12_intro_response_2|Mind your business, maggot!
str_npc13_intro_response_2|Mind your business!
str_npc14_intro_response_2|Mind your business!
str_npc15_intro_response_2|Hmmf. Keep your little claws to yourself, Snaga.
str_npc16_intro_response_2|Mind your business!
str_npc17_intro_response_2|Yes, the woods are lovely, but I've got to run along now.
str_npc1_backstory_a|You come at a difficult time, friend. Ithilien is flooded by enemy scouts and raiders, and some had seen great hosts of orcs on the move. We do try to prevent the foul creatures from crossing the great river and I have led a group of skilled Rangers to many a success. My Captain Faramir is bold and I don't despair of the Shadow hanging over us.
str_npc2_backstory_a|Ah, how graceful to inquire about me. I have been newly assigned as a guard of His Stewardship's hallways, a proud duty, if I may say so, if not very eventful.
str_npc3_backstory_a|Well, my old helmet here is getting smaller by the minute and the ground seems wobbly as if I rode a mischievous foil. Ah, if I only hadn't drank all that ale last night - I normally have a good head for drink, so it must have been some nasty orc brew.
str_npc4_backstory_a|My name is Gálmynë, and I made it my business to know yours, {playername}. Let me explain why.
str_npc5_backstory_a|You may have heard tales of my deeds in battles past and forgotten by mortal Men. In the fullness of time this War is yet another time of danger for the Eldar, but it will be the Last War.
str_npc6_backstory_a|Excuse my brashness, stranger, but we don't have many visitors here and those that come do not look very trustworthy. Only a week ago, this dwarf appeared and... Never mind. My name is Luevanna, of the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood.
str_npc7_backstory_a|Polite of you to ask, {playername}. We are fighting off incursions from Easterlings and Gundabad orcs, but so far nothing we and our Dale allies can't handle.
str_npc8_backstory_a|I'm sure you can find some fine volunteers if you speak to the quartermaster in the barracks. As for me, I'm merely a healer and herbalist of modest skills.
str_npc9_backstory_a|Good for you! They call me Gulm. I have gutted my sergeant and his snaga s now hunt for me.^The worthless piglet had it coming! Once, we got ambushed by a strawheads patrol... and he lost it. 'Fall back' he screams, then flees. Only Gulm and a few others stood firm, and broke their horses charge. Then we bludgeoned the yellow-haired into paste (heh heh heh). But if it wasn't for us strong ones, all would be worm food!
str_npc10_backstory_a|I am Durgash!
str_npc11_backstory_a|Nar! Not a tracker, that's who. They threw me out! I tell you they've lost their heads, that's what it is. Curse 'em! First they say I shoot wild, then I run too slow, and then I have a useless snuffler. Garn! If they don't find a rabble for me soon I'll be for the Black Pits, if what I hear is true. I'll make sure some of those Bosses lose their skins sooner than putting me in there!
str_npc12_backstory_a|I'm in command of a band of lads up here. I'm Gorbag and you'd best learn quick lubber us Uruks are the real bosses 'round here. The Big Bosses makes slips, 'ay, even the Biggest can make mistakes, and always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. They don't even tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. Grr!
str_npc13_backstory_a|I? I am a grain of soil from southern sands, blown north by cold and dark night winds. I am Lykyada, a Serpent Lord of Haradwaith. Lord of the Gold Serpent, bane of the Black Serpent Tribe, now allied to serve the will of the Dark Lord.
str_npc14_backstory_a|I am Fuldimir, son of the southern realm of Umbar, south of Harondor, and the Bay of Belfalas, for both are home to my heart and my people. We are the lords of sea and sail, corsairs to some, kin of the Bay of Belfalas for her waters we tame.
str_npc15_backstory_a|I am Bolzog the Gifted, Setter of Bones, Closer of Cuts, and Shaman of Healing. If you go to war for The Eye, you will no doubt have one or other of your little fellows cut about a bit by pale-faced foresters or the horse-lovers. Now, -nar-nar-nar! - Orcs are easy to replace, Oh Great Leader, but can you replace a Warg? A Giant? A Cave Troll? Shi-shi! No! You need me, the Great Bolzog!
str_npc16_backstory_a|Well now, it is the stranger who should declare himself first. Nevertheless, I am Varfang of the Balcoth kin... I can tell that you have not yet heard the songs or tales of my land that speak the name of the Balcoth, for the very name would check your courage and fill your heart with woe.
str_npc17_backstory_a|They call me Dímborn and I work in the woods. It is nice there. I like the woods. Many trees in the woods. I like trees. I've worked in the woods all my life, because I am strong and because I like trees.
str_npc1_backstory_b|You should know that I am an Ithilien Ranger of Dúnedain descent and valor. I know much of tracking and scouting and my skill with bow and sword is known to the orc. I can also train any soul that's willing to fight the coming Shadow.
str_npc2_backstory_b|I have been trained as a Minas Tirith watchman, to keep order in the White City and serve my lord Steward.
str_npc3_backstory_b|I am a Rider of the West Emnet éored - they left without me on a long patrol to the Isen fords. I know their conduct will be worthy of the green banner, but I fear many won't return.
str_npc4_backstory_b|I was born into a noble family and I have been serving Lady Éowyn as a maid of honour ever since we were little girls. Our fathers were wise enough to allow us to train alongside our brothers in matters of combat, to become shieldmaidens of Rohan.
str_npc5_backstory_b|Lord Elrond sent me as an emissary to Lord Celeborn, to give aid and advice as it's needed in the War in this part of Rhovanion.
str_npc6_backstory_b|I like to walk the hidden paths in our beautiful forest. Sometimes I move quietly through the trees and observe the habits of the many woodland animals. The song of a rare bird, the nesting of a wild boar are as beautiful to me as the clash of weapons and great walls are to the Edain.
str_npc7_backstory_b|I helped improve the Erebor defenses and trained some younger dwarven folk, under the direction of my venerated father Dwalin, as is our custom.
str_npc8_backstory_b|I have treated my King Brand for constipation, a common malaise affecting men going to war. A light brew of wormwood, and both the bowels and the mind are put at ease.
str_npc9_backstory_b|So I said to myself, 'Gulm, you want end up as carrion?' and I answered, 'No'.^Next battle, I fell back pretending I was injured. Then, with no one watching, I fell upon my sergeant! Cleaved him almost in half, gharr! Then cut his sidekick snaga nicely^^...Turned out that bloody creeper survived somehow, and started waggling his tongue about all this. Next time I make sure his head is off, gharr...
str_npc10_backstory_b|I am a Wolf Rider of Isengard and a tracker.
str_npc11_backstory_b|Ar! It's only 'cause my nose was snotty. An' what good is it wearing my nose out on stones anyhow? Nar! It was those filthy Uruks! Those cursed peaching sneakthiefs! I only lost the scent through giving way to them. They messed up the scent back there, pinching anything they found, and stomping all round the place before I could get there.
str_npc12_backstory_b|And those Nazgul give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving in the city. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em.
str_npc13_backstory_b|I saw of late the word of the Dark Lord spread among my kin, and in their hearts and minds his will crept. Most were drawn to his darkness, and in place of their courage grew an insatiable lust for slaughter so that when their ears heard his call few puppets were so willing to answer.
str_npc14_backstory_b|There is much change in a man who rides the tumult of the winds and seas of the Belfalas waters, and those yet to battle her will are but children. For stout men are they who meet her tempest and ride her storm. I have laid eyes on her darkest tide and yet remain her master.
str_npc15_backstory_b|Many moons ago, when I was just a fresh little thing, my Grandsire led the tribe down into the mines, where the dwarves had recently died. A Fire Wraith had passed through, and it was comfortable and warm. We prospered, but every so often some cruel adventurer, or Dwarf hero, would come and kill and maim us in our peaceful tunnels. My hands learned to close the wound of sword or axe, and my mind learned to see the outline of bone and sinew below any hide. These days, I can work a potion or set a break with equal skill.
str_npc16_backstory_b|The Balcoth were a fierce race of men from my home land, slaughtered by these westerlings to all but a few men. Chased down like beasts of burden as food for their blades. The blood spilt by those blades is the same blood that flows within me, for within me their house continues.
str_npc17_backstory_b|You can make many things out of the trees, you know. It's what I do. I work with trees and make things out of trees. Sometimes bushes also. But I like trees more.
str_npc1_backstory_c|However, I fear we are hopelessly outnumbered here in Ithilien and we won't last long without reinforcements or bolder action by our Steward. I might as well help where my actions would account for more, if my Captain Faramir gives me leave.
str_npc2_backstory_c|However important my duty here is, I'm quite anxious to see real combat and... elves and talking trees and oliphaunts! You seem well-travelled, commander, and I don't mean that as a slight on your appearance, not by a fathom. I learn quickly and can cook... well, good enough for soldiers that is. Am I not mistaken that you are looking for volunteers?
str_npc3_backstory_c|So, here I am, disgraced and bitter. My éored must be miles away now, and I wouldn't have a fair chance of catching up with them, not with all the orcs and wildmen roaming the plains. Are you by any chance in need of a fine Rohirrim rider?
str_npc4_backstory_c|You might know that women, however skilled, are not allowed to ride with the éoredas. However, I do not think that waiting by the hearth for the warriors to return is my fate. I will not sit idle until all chance of great deeds is gone in this War, and I would welcome your assistance, warrior.
str_npc5_backstory_c|However, if the enemies of Lothlórien are on the run, I might consider joining you for a while, {playername}. I sense our fates in this War are interwoven.
str_npc6_backstory_c|You wouldn't understand that, I think, seeing you prepared for war. But you must have travelled far and wide - have you seen the other great forests? Can you take me there?
str_npc7_backstory_c|There is a lull in the fighting that ill-suits a dwarven warrior of my ancestry and temperament. I gather you get to see much more action in your travels and your cause is friendly with the dwarves? I know a fighting dwarf will greatly improve your chances of survival.
str_npc8_backstory_c|I hear there is much fighting elsewhere and our lands are gratefully spared for now. From the scratches on your armor you must have been in danger many times. Maybe my humble skills could be better used with your company, for the greater good of all.
str_npc9_backstory_c|I am a fighting Uruk-hai, and a berserker! What there is to know of killing men, I know it. I was in the service of the White Hand, but now the Hand would as likely throw me into the fire-pits.^^I would come with you and hunt men in the south, while the snagas of Isengard gnash their teeth.
str_npc10_backstory_c|Maybe you can be my next master.
str_npc11_backstory_c|All right, all right! My nose isn't much use. I reckon my eyes are better than my nose. Ai! But my nose is only no good cause it don't know what nothing smells like. It don't even know what it's looking for, I tell you. Ar! I just need to go lopin' off and start sniffing places.
str_npc12_backstory_c|Eh, if I get a chance, I'll slip off and set up somewhere on my own with a few trusty lads, somewhere there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em, like old times.
str_npc13_backstory_c|I followed my kin north, and heeded his dark call, to fulfill the duty I have to my people. But in them I see his darkness dwell and I seek to do my part in this war elsewhere, until the sands of my time no longer fall. Even now I feel them begin to trickle where before there was a cascade.
str_npc14_backstory_c|But there comes yet the darkest tide, a black tide of shadow, which will rise over these lands such as which no mortal eyes will have seen. This is the tide I seek to master, but I am without a crew hardy enough to ride this storm.
str_npc15_backstory_c|After many winters I came up out of the tunnels, and looked about in the Dark Forests for a good place to live and practice my arts. I was doing fine, until some big ugly bastards with white tattoos – eugh! White! Like an elf face! – big bastards, they were. They fired my little place in the Forest, and I had to hide in the caves again... In here... Say, have you anything to eat? Maybe a nice horse?
str_npc16_backstory_c|That was many lives of men ago, a different time, but the time for grief and tales are over. The time for my people's retribution has come and I will carve my people's vengeance on the face of these western lands. By my hand, their homes will waste and wither until their clan is no more!
str_npc17_backstory_c|If you're going into the forest, maybe I come along and tell you about the trees there? Many very interesting trees there, you know.
str_npc1_backstory_later|I have been leading scouting parties to the south, as far as Emyn Arnen. There is much Enemy activity and many an orc fell to our ambush. Alas, that's only so many orc heads rolling down the gullies, we saw a myriad of foul creatures on the march. I fear for my Ithilien and the fate of Gondor.
str_npc2_backstory_later|We've had a few visitors lately, and there are fewer to come. I reckon that doesn't bode well.
str_npc3_backstory_later|Still no news of my éored, and I'm keen on riding down some orcs.
str_npc4_backstory_later|More riders return with their bodies broken, and I try to give aid where I can. But I still feel trapped in a cage.
str_npc5_backstory_later|Have you reconsidered? The time for the Eldar grows short.
str_npc6_backstory_later|I've been observing a nest of giant spiders for a couple of days. Ugly creatures, they seem at first, but they keep intruders at bay. Did you come to ask me to travel with you?
str_npc7_backstory_later|Building up defensive walls is worthy of any dwarf. But I need to use my axe too. Soon. Let me come with you.
str_npc8_backstory_later|I made another call to our King, this time for vomiting. I hope his resolve to engage the enemy is not related to his conditions. Do you suffer from constipation and vomiting too?
str_npc9_backstory_later|What do you think I do? Gulm is sitting here and waiting for some sneaky snaga to stick him in the dark. Take me with you - I will serve well.
str_npc10_backstory_later|Have you reconsidered? I will serve well.
str_npc11_backstory_later|Ar! It was you! I smelt you, I knew you were coming. Tell the Bosses that, will ya? They think since I was kicked out of the trackers that it's safe to flout me, well they're mistaken, I'll put an arrow in their guts first. And whose blames was that? Not mine!
str_npc12_backstory_later|I have my orders. Any trespasser found by my lads up here are to be stripped; teeth, nails, hair and all. But I've got my watchers. We know there are funny things going on: with the big bosses going off to war, and all that. Big things going on away west, they say. Sitting here doin' nothing is more than my belly's worth.
str_npc13_backstory_later|My role here goes well for the dark cause, and once more the Northerners fear the south. I see great victories ahead, and rivers of blood left in our wake. But with each victory I see my kin corrupted, their hearts twisted to his evil will. The sight of it leads me to despair.
str_npc14_backstory_later|You have returned stranger, it is perhaps an omen. I have been reading the waters, and I have seen them darken. The sea changes the eyes of a man, and teaches him to use his eyes to listen to her language.
str_npc15_backstory_later|Many have been the great ones who have begged to be healed by my potions.   Horselovers and the pale-faced elves are many though, and I have had to abandon my hut once more, and am... well, Great Lord, I am not so lucky as when we fought together, and you were grateful for my skills...
str_npc16_backstory_later|Long does the history of my people recount these lands. I know not what their treacherous histories say of days when my people before entered this land, but sad and dark will their histories be as my people enter it now. Like a storm of hooves and swords and arrows, we will bring them doom like the Balcoth before us.
str_npc17_backstory_later|I've seen a very old pine the other day. Pines can get very old. You have to respect old trees. But I've also seen some that don't respect trees at all. You respect trees, don't you?
str_npc1_backstory_response_1|If you can get leave, I have much need of an experienced warrior and a tracker.
str_npc2_backstory_response_1|You are correct, I am looking for volunteers.
str_npc3_backstory_response_1|If you can do without ale, I would welcome a good horseman.
str_npc4_backstory_response_1|I would welcome the help of a Rohan shieldmaiden, if offered.
str_npc5_backstory_response_1|It may be presumptuous of me to ask, but my company could use your skill in the coming battles.
str_npc6_backstory_response_1|We travel the world, but to defend all that is fair, we give battle to the enemy.
str_npc7_backstory_response_1|Indeed, a dwarven warrior would be welcome in my company.
str_npc8_backstory_response_1|We can use a healer and a herbalist.
str_npc9_backstory_response_1|I reckon we could put a berserker to a good use.
str_npc10_backstory_response_1|You will do.
str_npc11_backstory_response_1|How 'bout loping off with me?
str_npc12_backstory_response_1|How 'bout slippin' off with me.
str_npc13_backstory_response_1|How about following me?
str_npc14_backstory_response_1|How about joining me?
str_npc15_backstory_response_1|Aha... A healer, heh? And you are good at it, you say? I could use someone like you.
str_npc16_backstory_response_1|What are you doing here?
str_npc17_backstory_response_1|Well, one can always learn more about trees. We'd be glad to have you along.
str_npc1_backstory_response_2|I am sorry to hear that. May your faith sustain your valor.
str_npc2_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. I'm looking for seasoned warriors.
str_npc3_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. I'm looking for someone more reliable.
str_npc4_backstory_response_2|I am sorry, my Lady, there's nothing I can do.
str_npc5_backstory_response_2|I'll be back when Lothlórien is in less danger.
str_npc6_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. We cannot take hangers-on.
str_npc7_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. We do well on our own.
str_npc8_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. We only visit healers when we need them.
str_npc9_backstory_response_2|Bah. I don't trust traitors.
str_npc10_backstory_response_2|I don't need you, slave.
str_npc11_backstory_response_2|I don't want to hear your skulking.
str_npc12_backstory_response_2|The Big Bosses know best. You better follow orders.
str_npc13_backstory_response_2|That is your fate to suffer.
str_npc14_backstory_response_2|I've had enough of this.
str_npc15_backstory_response_2|Bah! I need fighters, not skulkers.
str_npc16_backstory_response_2|I've had enough of this.
str_npc17_backstory_response_2|No, I'm sorry. We're off to war, not to a botanical journey.
str_npc1_signup|I am sure Captain Faramir would understand there are others who can keep the Enemy at bay with even more valor and courage.
str_npc2_signup|Oh, a happy day! I would be glad to join your company.
str_npc3_signup|Trust me, commander, all the ale I need is the sweet drink of victory. If you can lead me against the enemy, they will soon feel the business end of a Rohirrim spear!
str_npc4_signup|It is gladly offered, and you can welcome me to your company, commander.
str_npc5_signup|I see. I admit I have heard of you and your exploits.
str_npc6_signup|I dislike violence and weapons of war, but I know how to defend myself in a hurry.
str_npc7_signup|I am skilled with an axe, both the wielding and the throwing type. I can also keep your bills low if you let me talk to the merchants. And I have an eye for finding the best pieces of loot from fallen enemies on the battlefield.
str_npc8_signup|Indeed? Well then, I merely need to gather my herbs and recipees.
str_npc9_signup|A fighting Uruk is worth more than all your snagas. A fighting Uruk never runs from battle.
str_npc10_signup|Really? You would do well to enlist me.
str_npc11_signup|Follow your mob Ai? Ar! I hear about all these goings-ons out west, raids and all, and hundreds of our lads done in. I'll come and have a look with you all the same, and see what you're up to.
str_npc12_signup|Follow your rabble, 'ay? I may 'ave struck a bit of luck at last. I give a good rumble, I reckon, and my whip is vigilant. It's tasted its fair share of my lads' orc hide.
str_npc13_signup|I may follow you if you will have me. My legs make good heading of a horse between them and my hands know well the feel of blades of the crescent moon. My fingers can make fall arrows like the plight of stars upon our enemy, be it on horse or feet, though how I fight will be at your command.
str_npc14_signup|Perhaps, know though that I am no thief or brigand. I will not steal, nor take that which other lives may find needed.
str_npc15_signup|Heh-heh. You are right! Yeesss! You are wise, Great Captain.
str_npc16_signup|I wait for orders, with every second passing darkening my heart. I can no longer stand to wait for the plans of far away lords and captains so unseen their existence is believed more in legend than in flesh. Lords whose whispered orders are brought forth and shouted by lesser men. I wait, and with me, my people's vengeance waits also.
str_npc17_signup|Very good! I know many trees. Soon you will know many trees too. Like me. Because I know many trees.
str_npc1_signup_2|It would take a moment to talk to my Captain and gather my things.
str_npc2_signup_2|I'll need to talk to my Sergeant first and then off we go - there are glorious battles to be fought and all manners of strange creatures to see!
str_npc3_signup_2|I've been waiting for someone to take me on, so I only need to saddle up my horse and we are ready to ride.
str_npc4_signup_2|I have hunted game many times with bows and throwing spears. I will hunt orc under your command. And I have some skill in healing I'm certain will be needed.
str_npc5_signup_2|Perhaps by joining your company and striking hard where I am not expected, the Enemy will be unbalanced. I will come.
str_npc6_signup_2|Perhaps I can teach you to move faster and make less noise. Let's go.
str_npc7_signup_2|If you can keep the tall-folk in your company in line, especially the sneaky Elves, I'll gladly join you.
str_npc8_signup_2|I must warn you though, I am fairly useless in battle. But I'm sure you are able to keep a woman of my age safe.
str_npc9_signup_2|But you must decide quickly, the guards here are getting suspicious.
str_npc10_signup_2|You won't regret taking me on.
str_npc11_signup_2|Lots of stuff out there for my nose to smell too, and my knife to taste. They don't know too much now but they're quick learners alright. What d'you say?
str_npc12_signup_2|I'll show your slugs where there's a whip there's a will and give 'em as much lash as their skins will carry. If your lads take it well it should put 'em in a good trot. What d'you say?
str_npc13_signup_2|Know, though, that my loyalty lie always with my kin. I have fought this far and lost too much for them. I will not turn my back on them for their fate will be my own.
str_npc14_signup_2|It is just fortunate that those no longer of this world find no need of this world's treasures and I am fortunate to be skilled in ways that I may assist in relieving the worldly needs of the owners of those treasures.
str_npc15_signup_2|Oh, this is a great moment for Bolzog The Gifted, and for you, Great Lord! We shall conquer together, you, indestructible with my healing touch, and I, the Great Orc Sage who shall support you!
str_npc16_signup_2|I fear that I will not wait any longer. I intend on joining the next party to leave camp, with my Chieftain's approval or not. I fear the war will be over long ere I leave to join it.
str_npc17_signup_2|I'll just get some of my tools, and we can be off. There is this oak just down the road I must show you!
str_npc1_signup_response_1|I could use a skilled ranger, you are welcome to join.
str_npc2_signup_response_1|Very well. We could use some cheer in these dark times.
str_npc3_signup_response_1|Very well. Saddle up - we shall be leaving shortly.
str_npc4_signup_response_1|Impressive. We are ready to leave, whenever you are, my Lady.
str_npc5_signup_response_1|We will be honoured to have the company of an Elf-lord.
str_npc6_signup_response_1|Very well. I hope you won't run away from the first orc we see.
str_npc7_signup_response_1|Very well, Master Dwarf, you are welcome to join us.
str_npc8_signup_response_1|You will be safe with us, I promise. We will be leaving shortly.
str_npc9_signup_response_1|Very good. Do as you are told, and I'll feed you well.
str_npc10_signup_response_1|Very well. Let's go.
str_npc11_signup_response_1|Very well. Let's go.

str_npc13_signup_response_1|I reckon we could put you to good use.
str_npc14_signup_response_1|Very well. Let's go.
str_npc15_signup_response_1|Hmmm. I admire your... confidence. Get your gear together.
str_npc16_signup_response_1|How about following me?
str_npc17_signup_response_1|Great! I hope you won't talk of trees all the time though.
str_npc1_signup_response_2|I have no need of your company at the moment, good luck to you.
str_npc2_signup_response_2|Sorry, I've changed my mind.
str_npc3_signup_response_2|Sorry, I've changed my mind - maybe next time.
str_npc4_signup_response_2|I apologize, my Lady, perhaps another time.
str_npc5_signup_response_2|On second thought, maybe we need to help Lothlórien on our own.
str_npc6_signup_response_2|Sorry, I just can't imagine you on a battlefield.
str_npc7_signup_response_2|Sorry, I happen to like Elves.
str_npc8_signup_response_2|I'm sorry, everyone fights in my company.
str_npc9_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind. Whoever is looking for you might come for me next.
str_npc10_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind.
str_npc11_signup_response_2|I don't need you, slave.
str_npc12_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind.
str_npc13_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind.
str_npc14_signup_response_2|I've changed my mind.
str_npc15_signup_response_2|Actually, I think I'll look for a real healer and not a braggart.
str_npc16_signup_response_2|I've had enough of this.
str_npc17_signup_response_2|On the other hand, I think I've changed my mind. You're a bit of a nut, aren't you?
str_npc1_payment|I would join you, but my Captain Faramir would miss my presence here. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc2_payment|The guard Sergeant would not let me go, I'm afraid. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc3_payment|Ahem, it seems that I have ran up quite a tab in the fine tavern here, so I'll need to settle my account before I can leave. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc4_payment|I would join you, but who will care for the wounded if the city is attacked? [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc5_payment|We should be off soon. The value of my coming will be diminished if the Enemy senses my presence before we have struck. But Lothlórien also needs me here. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]

str_npc11_payment|I just need someone to do in the Boss. We could wait till he closes his eyes to lop off, but I reckon someone really high up can force his eyes shut. Ai! [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc12_payment|Hai! Yoi! I'll need to remind the boys to keep their mangy gobs shut or the High Ups will get my number and 'ave it out for me, they will. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]

str_npc14_payment|The captain of the Haven will require much persuasion for my leave. Convince him and we shall set sail through this storm. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc15_payment|Ah, yes. Noble Warrior-Lord! One small impediment is there! A great injustice befell me, that the master of this cave did not like my offer of healing, and has stolen all my gear! The cheek! To steal from the Great Bolzog! Master, I can't recover my priceless equipment from his filthy claws! [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]
str_npc16_payment|I will not follow you, I will go my own path; but your path may go along with mine for a while.

They have not forgotten us. [costs {reg14} Influence with {s14}]

str_npc1_morality_speech|Captain, I can't understand how you can {s21} and forsake our men. Captain Faramir would have never lost sight of compassion for his Rangers and caused them to suffer without need.
str_npc2_morality_speech|I hope you don't mind my saying so, but it's a bit hard for me to see us {s21}. Maybe I ought to try to be more of a hardened soldier, but if you could try to be more... caring about our soldiers, I'd sleep better.
str_npc3_morality_speech|Commander, we Eorlingas never {s21}. Our horses don't tire easily and, once we regroup, there is no situation a well-timed charge can't decide in our favour. Take heed the next time we battle against the odds.
str_npc4_morality_speech|Take no heed to what the soldiers say, sometimes to {s21} is the wisest course of action. I for one appreciate the lives spared and limbs unbroken, if for nothing else but to fight another day, when fate looks upon us with favor.
str_npc5_morality_speech|You must reconsider your actions, commander. To {s21} makes us no more honourable than the Enemy and diminishes the confidence of our friends.

str_npc7_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honour for any right-thinking dwarf, but to fight in a company led by a coward is a disgrace. What will my cousins say if they learn of this?
str_npc8_morality_speech|Commander, I must object. To {s21} is harsh on the men and unnecessary. I do what I can to ease their suffering, but please don't make another costly mistake.
str_npc9_morality_speech|The fighting Uruk-hai don't {s21}. If the Master has little guts, he might find himself without them one night. Gulm has spoken.





str_npc15_morality_speech|You may think that Bolzog the Great can cure all, {playername}, but even I have my limits! If you continue to {s21} even my talent will struggle! You must give me some support! I cannot resurrect the dead, whether they starve or are hacked to pieces!


str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|Captain, I have been raised as a Dúnedain, both in valor and honour. I would prefer if we don't {s21}.


str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|Your pardon, commander. Women of my station will accept death but not dishonour. To {s21} brings shame to my house and ancestors.










str_npc15_2ary_morality_speech|Hi-hi-hi! You are cunning, Oh Lord! You take the gold, and nod, and say 'yes master' but all the time you planned this! Hi-Hi! Only, we must be careful, that The Big One does not see you deceiving him...


str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|Did I mention I hate {s11}?
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|Did I mention I hate {s11}?
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|Commander, how come we ended up with {s11} in our company? He's nimble enough on foot, I reckon, but he talks of ambushes too often for my liking - not unlike the cautious nature of his people.
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|Did I mention I hate {s11}?
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|Did I mention I hate {s11}?
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|{playername}, I just saw {s11} walk brazenly over a nest of young birds. His clumsiness destroyed the young lives of innocent creatures.
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|Lord {s11} does well in a battle, but I wonder if he blinds the enemy by the shine of his hair? Or they fall in awe of his fame and uppity demeanor?
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|Commander, I must lodge a complaint against {s11}. He continues to pester me about making him a certain brew called 'the green fairy'.

str_npc2_personalityclash_speech_b|I hate {s11}.
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech_b|I don't have a quarrel with the people of Gondor, but we would do better with more bold horsemen and less reluctant ground-huggers, if you catch my drift.
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech_b|I hate {s11}.
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech_b|I hate {s11}.
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech_b|His dwarven ways may serve him well underground, albeit it's a wonder he hasn't fallen down an ugly shaft. Maybe he should have.
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech_b|We would do better with a dwarven hero, someone like Durin the Deathless of old, and let the Elves prance around their forests.
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech_b|It is made from wormwood soaked in liquor and apparently favored by minstrels and vagrants for seeing things that are not there. I doubt you'll approve of your soldiers chasing air on the battlefield, as much as it may be amusing to watch.

str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech_b|I hate {s11}.
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech_b|I saw her cowering in the rear, barely releasing an arrow or two in the general direction of the enemy. I say let her go to take care of the birds and bees, so we can go on with the bloody work of slaying the enemy.

str_npc17_personalityclash2_speech_b|I hate {s11}.
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|Have you noticed the grace of {s11} in that last battle? The way she moves around the enemy just before striking the final blow? It's like the stories of old, when elven maidens displayed as much poise on the battlefield as in their beautiful forest courts.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|Excuse me, commander. I was just helping {s11} with minor weapon repairs after that last scrap, and he even promised to teach me how to improve my strikes.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|Is not a Rohan shieldmaiden in full charge a sight to behold? Granted, our womenfolk are better off by the hearth, but after seeing {s11} strike down the enemy in that last battle, I'm beginning to have doubts.
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|A battle of great deeds, commander, and my congratulations on the victory. I noticed how {s11} quietly and surely took care of the wounded and ailing, even as the last of the enemy got what they deserved.
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|Did I mention I like {s11}?
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}, as much as I hate battles, I can't help but notice my Lord {s11} riding out in full splendor and bearing down on the ugly creatures like a hawk.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|Bloody and victorious, just as I like it! I did, however, sustain a flesh wound that {s11} was kind enough to bandage promptly.
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|Another victory for you, commander, and I admire your skill in sparing the lives of our men. Warriors like {s11} seem to be of great use in your battle plans.

str_npc17_personalitymatch_speech|Umm, chief. I think {s11} could make it well in the woods. Can tell an ash from a willow.
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech_b|I find the company of {s11} very pleasing and her native woodcraft a rare glimpse in what remains of Sindarin skills in the world. You know, my father named me after the legendary Sindarin Elf captain serving King Thingol of Doriath and I always feel a special bond to the fair race.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech_b|My folks at home always told me stories about the Ithilien Rangers and now I can see for myself they are all true. If they are all like {s11}, I feel Gondor is safer for it.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|Commander, as a personal favour, might I ask if you can order {s11} to stay more to the rear in the next battle? I could not stand to see her harmed, and it's not the ale talking.
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech_b|To preserve lives is the noblest deed, and I feel kinship with that kind soul, even if our worlds are far apart.
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech_b|I like {s11}.
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech_b|I wonder just how old is he. Maybe a dozen of centuries older than me? Never mind, you wouldn't understand.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech_b|{s11} and her Dale-kin, even if not quite up to dwarven warrior standards, have proven to be steadfast allies in this War. A good choice for a friend and companion among Men, if I may say so.
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|The people of Dale have a deep regard for the hardy Lonely Mountain Dwarven-folk, as friends and protectors despite our different race and customs.

str_npc14_rehire_speech|Can I serve you once again?
str_npc15_rehire_speech|Aah, Great Lord! I have searched so long for you, as word of your glorious deeds rings across Middle Earth! Surely you have missed my skills? You will welcome me once more to complete your Great Army?
str_npc16_rehire_speech|Can I serve you once again?
str_npc17_rehire_speech|Hey. Time to move on again? Trees don't move much. But I like to move. But I like trees too.
str_npc1_home_intro|Captain, we are approaching Osgiliath now, so let us be on the lookout for friend and foe alike.
str_npc2_home_intro|Be vigilant, commander, that must be Minas Morgul over there. Do you feel that something is watching us?
str_npc3_home_intro|A word of advice, commander. We are getting mighty close to Entwood now and the horses are getting restless. Some call the forest Fangorn, too.
str_npc4_home_intro|Let's stop here for a minute, commander. Ahead of us, between the Anduin and the Limlight, lies the Field of Celebrant, where Eorl the Young rode to the aid of our Gondor allies.
str_npc5_home_intro|Daro! That's Isengard and the black tower of Orthanc ahead. Much have changed since I last saw them, and none for the better.
str_npc6_home_intro|Excuse me, {playername}. The paths in this part become more twisted and some lead to dead-ends. We must be approaching Dol Guldur.
str_npc7_home_intro|Oy, captain! This must be the old path to the Eastern Gates of Khazad-dûm, or Moria as you may prefer. You can see in the distance the glittering lake of Kheled-zâram, and, through the clouds, the three peaks known to grace this part of the Misty Mountains.
str_npc8_home_intro|Oh, a curious sight! I heard stories about this place where sturdy woodmen are said to live in harmony with animals and plants. Beornings they are called, I gather.
str_npc9_home_intro|Curses! That must be Hornburg over there, master.
str_npc10_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc11_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc12_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc13_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc14_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc15_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc16_home_intro|Hey, look!
str_npc17_home_intro|Ooooo, mallorns grow here! One should never cut down a mallorn, they're just too beautiful!
str_npc1_home_description|It was a fair city once, the capital of Gondor of old, full of people and laughter. Now it lies deserted and ruined, the old Anduin flowing wearily through a ghost town.
str_npc2_home_description|It was called Minas Ithil many years ago, and stories are told of how moonlight filled its inner courts with silver light and its walls gleamed silver and white. Gondor watchmen peered over the walls to the east and kept watch beyond Ephel Dúath.
str_npc3_home_description|It's thick with trunks and branches and all manner of trees, and I wouldn't venture there as strange creatures roam the forest, not all of them harmless.
str_npc4_home_description|'Where now the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing?^Where is the helm and the hauberk and the bright hair flowing?...^They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;^The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow...'
str_npc5_home_description|Once built by the Southern Kingdom, now home to one that we called the White Wizard, scheming, no doubt, how to increase his power further at the expense of others.
str_npc6_home_description|I have never ventured this far, but I overheard our Greenwood scouts say there may be Nazguls here. I feel an evil presence, but I cannot put a name to it. It is powerful, though, so let us be prepared.
str_npc7_home_description|Judging by the desolation, and the many orc-tracks, I fear for the fate of the courageous Balin and his expedition. It seems that Moria has fallen to the Shadow and we should tread carefully.
str_npc8_home_description|Not too often, a travelling merchant comes to the Dale market and offers the finest honey I have ever tasted. For some curious reason, he says that 'it was made by bears' and laughs.
str_npc9_home_description|Its damned walls are too high and too hard for my hammer to break. I reckon if we ever chase away the manlings from their Edoras pig-sties, they'll run off here and cower behind the walls.
str_npc10_home_description|Do you know that town?
str_npc11_home_description|Do you know that town?
str_npc12_home_description|Do you know that town?
str_npc13_home_description|Do you know that town?

str_npc15_home_description|Do you know that town?

str_npc1_home_description_2|If Gondor is doomed, West Osgiliath shall fall first to the foul hordes of the Eye. I only hope Captain Faramir would be in command that day and stem the tide. If we could spare any men to bolster the defences here, I would be most grateful, Captain.
str_npc2_home_description_2|It is said it's full of terrible orcs now and dread spirits and worse. I pray for the day when Gondor will reclaim it and cleanse it of all things foul.

str_npc9_home_description_2|There's no use trudging around here if we are not backed by a large Uruk-hai horde. Unless you want to make faces at the lookouts on the wall, that is.

str_battle_won_martial|There is no greater fortune than the chance to show one's valor on the field of arms!
str_battle_won_quarrelsome|Hah! We showed those bastards a thing or two, there, didn't we?
str_battle_won_pitiless|Together, we will make the foe learn to fear our names, and to quail at our coming!
str_battle_won_cunning|Now, we must be sure to press our advantage, so that the blood shed today is not wasted.
str_battle_won_sadistic|Now let us strip their dead and leave them for the crows, so that all will know the fate of those who come against us.
str_battle_won_goodnatured|That was a good scrap! No joy like the joy of victory, eh?
str_battle_won_upstanding|Now, let us give thanks to the heavens for our victory, and mourn the many fine men who have fallen today.
str_battle_won_grudging_default|You helped turn the tide on the field, today. Whatever I may think of you, I cannot fault you for your valor.

str_battle_won_grudging_quarrelsome|Hmf. Yours is not a face which I normally like to see, but I suppose today I should thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_grudging_pitiless|Your help was most valuable today. I would not imagine that you came to help me out of kindness, but I nonetheless thank you.
str_battle_won_grudging_cunning|It would be unwise of me not to thank you for coming to help me in my hour of need. So... You have my gratitude.
str_battle_won_grudging_sadistic|Well! How touching! {playername} has come to rescue me.
str_battle_won_grudging_goodnatured|{playername}! I can't say that we've always gotten along in the past, but you fought well today. My thanks to you!
str_battle_won_grudging_upstanding|Perhaps I was wrong about you. Your arrival was most timely. You have my gratitude.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_default|So you're here. Well, better late than never, I suppose.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_martial|We have hard harsh words in the past, but for now let us simply enjoy our victory.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_quarrelsome|If you're standing there waiting for thanks, you can keep waiting. Your help wasn't really needed, but I guess you had nothing better to do, right?
str_battle_won_unfriendly_pitiless|You have come here, like a jackal to a lion's kill. Very well then, help yourself to the spoils. I shall not stop you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_cunning|{playername}... Well, I suppose your arrival didn't hurt, although I won't pretend that I'm happy to see you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_sadistic|Back off, carrion fowl! This was my victory, however hard you try to steal the glory for yourself.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_goodnatured|Oh, it's you. Well, I suppose I should thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_upstanding|Thank you for coming to my support. Now I will be off, before I say something that I regret.
str_troop_train_request_default|I need someone like you to knock them into shape.
str_troop_train_request_martial|They need someone to show them the meaning of valor.
str_troop_train_request_quarrelsome|Fat lazy bastards. They make me puke.
str_troop_train_request_pitiless|They are more afraid of the enemy than they are of me, and this will not do.
str_troop_train_request_cunning|But men, like swords, are tempered and hardened by fire.
str_troop_train_request_sadistic|They need someone with steel in his back to flog some courage into them, or kill them trying.
str_troop_train_request_goodnatured|They're good enough lads, but I am afraid that they are not quite ready for a battle just yet.
str_troop_train_request_upstanding|It would be tantamount to murder for me to lead them into combat in their current state.
str_unprovoked_attack_default|What? Why do you attack us? Speak, you rascal!
str_unprovoked_attack_martial|I have no objection to a trial of arms, but I would ask you for what reason you attack us?
str_unprovoked_attack_quarrelsome|You're making a big mistake, {boy/girl}. What do you think you're doing?
str_unprovoked_attack_pitiless|Indeed? If you really want to die today, I'd be more than happy to oblige you, but I am curious as to what you hope to accomplish.
str_unprovoked_attack_cunning|Really? I think that you are acting most unwisely. What do you hope to gain by this?
str_unprovoked_attack_sadistic|What's this? Do you enjoy having your eyes put out?
str_unprovoked_attack_goodnatured|Why do you do this? We've got no quarrel, {sir/madame}.
str_unprovoked_attack_upstanding|I consider this an unprovoked assault, and will protest to your king. Why do you do this?
str_unnecessary_attack_default|I will not hesitate to cut you down if pressed, but I will offer you the chance to ride away from this.
str_unnecessary_attack_martial|I am eager to take you up on your challenge, {sir/madame}, although I will give you a minute to reconsider.
str_unnecessary_attack_quarrelsome|Bah! I'm in no mood for this nonsense today. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_pitiless|I am in a merciful mood today. I will pretend that I did not hear you.
str_unnecessary_attack_cunning|I don't see what you have to gain by making an enemy of me. Maybe you should just ride away.
str_unnecessary_attack_sadistic|I have no time to waste on a worm like you. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_goodnatured|I don't see what you have to gain by picking a fight, {sir/madame}. You can still ride away.
str_unnecessary_attack_upstanding|If a fight is what you wish, {sir/madame}, then you will have one, but I will yet offer you the chance to back down.
str_lord_challenged_default|As you wish. Prepare to die!
str_lord_challenged_martial|So be it. Defend yourself!
str_lord_challenged_quarrelsome|You impudent whelp! I'll crush you!
str_lord_challenged_pitiless|If you so badly wish to die, then I have no choice but to oblige you.
str_lord_challenged_cunning|Well, if you leave me no choice...
str_lord_challenged_sadistic|You heap of filth! I'll make you wish you'd never been born.
str_lord_challenged_goodnatured|Very well. I had hoped that we might avoid coming to blows, but I see that have no choice.
str_lord_challenged_upstanding|So be it. It saddens me that you cannot be made to see reason.
str_lord_mission_failed_default|Well, I am disappointed, but I am sure that you will have many chances to redeem yourself.
str_lord_mission_failed_martial|There is no honour in failing a quest which you endeavoured to take, but I will accept your word on it.
str_lord_mission_failed_quarrelsome|You failed? Bah. I should have expected as much from the likes of you.
str_lord_mission_failed_pitiless|You failed? Well. You disappoint me. That is a most unwise thing to do.
str_lord_mission_failed_cunning|Well, I am disappointed, but no one can guarantee that the winds of fortune will always blow their way.
str_lord_mission_failed_sadistic|Indeed? Those who fail me do not always live to regret it.
str_lord_mission_failed_goodnatured|Oh well. It was a long shot, anyway. Thank you for making an effort.
str_lord_mission_failed_upstanding|Very well. I am sure that you gave it your best effort.
str_lord_follow_refusal_default|Follow you? You forget your station, {sir/madame}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_martial|Perhaps if you one day prove yourself a valorous and honourable warrior, then I would follow you. But not today.
str_lord_follow_refusal_quarrelsome|Follow someone like you? I don't think so.
str_lord_follow_refusal_pitiless|Lords like me do not follow people like you, {sir/madame}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_cunning|First show me that you are the type of {man/woman} who will not lead me into disaster, and then perhaps I will follow you.
str_lord_follow_refusal_sadistic|I think not! Rather, you should follow me, as a whipped cur follows {his/her} master.
str_lord_follow_refusal_goodnatured|Um, I am a bit pressed with errands right now. Perhaps at a later date.

str_rebellion_dilemma_default|[liege]
str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave an oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped his throne illegally.
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't figure I owe him much. However, maybe {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself.
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. That is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weight my decision carefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath of homage to {s46}, yet the powerful are not bound by their oaths as our ordinary people. Our duty is to our own ability to rule, to impose order and prevent the war of all against all.
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this vile world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So -- what's in it for me?
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as the lawful ruler, but if he is not the lawful ruler, I don't know if I am still bound.
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This is troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my homage to {s46} to be null and void, and dissolve the bonds which keep our land from sinking into anarchy. Yet I am also pledged to support the legitimacy of the succession, and {s45} also has a valid claim to the throne.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_default|[liege]
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in war and peace, and I am loathe to renounce my allegiance.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_quarrelsome|So tell me, why should I turn my back on the bastard I know, in favor of {reg3?a woman:the bastard} I don't know?
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_pitiless|It is a most perilous position to be in, to be asked whom I would make {reg3?ruler:king} of this land. Yet it is also a time of opportunity, for me to reap the rewards that have always been my due!
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_cunning|{s46} has been challenged, and thus he will never be able to rule as strongly as one whose claim has never been questioned. Yet if {s45} takes the throne by force, {reg3?she:he} will not be as strong as one who succeeded peacefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me, but perhaps if I bring {s46} your head he will give me an even greater reward.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me decently, yet it's true that he did wrong to {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my homage to {s46}, yet I also don't think it's right to support injustice.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_upstanding|I feel that I must do whatever is best for the realm, to avoid it being laid waste by civil war and ravaged by its enemies.

str_rebellion_rival_pitiless|{s49} you seem to have enlisted the support of {s44} -- who is soft, and weak, and not fit to govern a fief, and whom I have always detested.
str_rebellion_rival_cunning|{s49} {s44}, who has already joined you, is headstrong and quarrelsome, and a bit of liability.
str_rebellion_rival_sadistic|{s49} I have no desire to fight alongside your ally {s44}, who puts on such a nauseating display of virtue.
str_rebellion_rival_goodnatured|{s49} I'd be reluctant to be on the same side as {s44}, who has quite a reputation for cruelty.

str_rebellion_agree_pitiless|You are fortunate. I have decided to join you. Pray do not give me cause to regret this decision.
str_rebellion_agree_cunning|This is a most dangerous decision, but after careful consideration, I have decided that I will join you. Let's hope it is for the best.
str_rebellion_agree_sadistic|I have decided. I will back your {reg3?woman:man} {s45}. But you'd best make sure that {reg3?she:he} rewards me well!
str_rebellion_agree_goodnatured|All right. I think your {reg3?woman:man} will be a good ruler. I'll join you.
str_rebellion_agree_upstanding|So be it. My first duty is to this realm, and to save it from lawlessness I will back {s45} and renounce my homage to {s46}. May the Heavens forgive me if I do wrong.

str_talk_later_pitiless|Still your tongue! Whatever I have to say on this matter, I will not say it here and now, while we are in the midst of our army.
str_talk_later_cunning|This is hardly the time or the place for such a discussion. Perhaps we can discuss it at a later time and a different place, but for now we're still foes.
str_talk_later_sadistic|You should have your mouth sewn shut! Can you imagine what would happen if the other vassals see me talking to you of treason?
str_talk_later_goodnatured|So you wish to discuss your rebellion with me? Try that again when we aren't surrounded by my liege's army, and I will hear what you have to say.

str_default_rumor|The War. Everybody is talking about the war.
str_rohan_rumor_begin|It breaks my heart to see my babies off to war! But without them the men would have to walk.
str_rohan_rumor_2|I hear orcs eat horses. Foul beasts! They also eat prisoners. That is bad too, of course.
str_rohan_rumor_3|There are no horses finer than Rohan's. Even the Elves get their horses from us!
str_rohan_rumor_4|If you can heal men, please treat my horses with just as much care should they be wounded.
str_rohan_rumor_5|Bring me eight Sumpter Horses, he says... after the seven he asked for yesterday.  Makes you wonder.
str_rohan_rumor_6|Gondor prefers sturdier horses. Our riders enjoy speed. The Elves get only the best. And our enemies steal them!
str_rohan_rumor_7|I've seen breeds of the desert mare and Variag horse. Rohan horses are clearly superiour but require a more experienced rider to handle.
str_rohan_rumor_8|Wargs are slower than horses but can turn faster. They are also quite fragile compared to a well-bred warhorse.
str_rohan_rumor_9|Armies march on Rohan with pikes and spears set against our fine horsemen. The traitor Saruman will cut down the whole Fangorn forest equipping his armies before this war is over.
str_rohan_rumor_10|Being the best horsemen in the realm starts with raising the best horses.
str_rohan_rumor_11|Most of the horses you see in Gondor came from us. They prefer a slightly stronger, slower horse that can carry their heavy armour.
str_rohan_rumor_12|We say in Rohan that a horse is like a man. That if a horse is good it is like a man is good, and that if a horse is bad, is like a man is bad. And if a horse is hungry is like a man is hungry, and if a horse is sad is like if a man is sad. And we say if a horse is happy is like when a man is happy. We say if a horse is angry is like if man is angry. We say if a horse walk is like when a man walk, we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old, and we say if horse is young is like when a man is young. And the same we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old. And if a horse small, is like when a man's small.
str_rohan_rumor_13|Saruman's orcs are nasty but don't wear much protection. They're no match for a good axe.
str_rohan_rumor_14|Our throwing axes and spears may seem bulky, but how many chances do you have to throw a missile before you ride down the foe? Make it count by throwing something with some heft.
str_rohan_rumor_15|Hitting an orc with an arrow loosed from horseback looks difficult because it is, but the price of charging a rank of long pikes is higher.
str_rohan_rumor_16|Gondor practices archery. We practice horse archery. Dunlendings practice neither.
str_rohan_rumor_17|Many of Saruman's orcs are deadly archers. Many are not. A wise cavalry commander shouldn't wait to discover which is which.
str_rohan_rumor_18|We are all friends here. Or should be; for the laughter of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel.
str_rohan_rumor_19|Long we have tended our beasts and our fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the wars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life of Men, the way of the world.
str_gondor_rumor_begin|Gondor has no king and enemies are at the doorstep. The shadow grows in the east. Things do not look good.
str_gondor_rumor_2|In Gondor there is nothing under the sun we don't make, build, or grow in some quantity. But for how much longer?
str_gondor_rumor_3|Mordor is a dry, infertile land. What do the creatures there eat? Surely not one another? Or maybe...
str_gondor_rumor_4|We toil our lands, as we have done for generations. Our past is glorious and brave, but our future looks uncertain.
str_gondor_rumor_5|The Shadow's resources for war seem limitless, but they are borne on the backs of a vast pool of slave labour.
str_gondor_rumor_6|We know of the elves in the north, but nowadays noone gets to see them anymore.
str_gondor_rumor_7|I would see the White Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens.
str_gondor_rumor_8|Why does Umbar keep invading us? Their Corsairs would have profited far more from trading with us. What plunder could match the riches they'd have hauled away selling old Numenorian artifacts to Gondorian nobles?
str_gondor_rumor_9|War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.
str_gondor_rumor_10|Gil-galad was an Elven-king. Of him the harpers sadly sing: the last whose realm was fair and free between the Mountains and the Sea.
str_gondor_rumor_11|Dol Guldur? Never heard of it.
str_gondor_rumor_12|Moria? The dwarves mine there, don't they?
str_gondor_rumor_13|Don't tell anyone I said this, but I think Prince Imrahil should perhaps become king. Lord Denethor is a noble man, but Gondor has faded much during his reign. And not only since his older son left.
str_gondor_rumor_14|People say the Nine rode out of Minas Morgul again. I wish we had more brave captains like Boromir to lead our men into battle against such ancient foes.
str_gondor_rumor_15|The Southerners are pushing us out of Harondor. They've been raiding us hard for some time. I wish I could walk safely through the green fields of Lebennin again. But we are told 'No.', our soldiers are to protect the heart of the realm.
str_gondor_rumor_16|My friend's cousin is a bowman in service of Hirluin the Fair. They have by far the best looking uniforms, if you ask me.
str_gondor_rumor_17|There is a strange black rock near Erech. I went to see it once with my father. People say it's laid over a chamber where the last son of the sea kings sleeps. I think it's just a rock.
str_gondor_rumor_18|We are truth-speakers, we Gondorians. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die in the attempt.
str_dwarf_rumor_begin|They ask us if dwarves have any friends. Of course we have friends. But we don't like them.
str_dwarf_rumor_2|Orcs? Pfft! Axe-grease, all they are.
str_dwarf_rumor_3|What's that you're wearing? It doesn't look like it would protect you from a bee sting. And it looks funny.
str_dwarf_rumor_4|Of course we can ride horses. We just don't want to!
str_dwarf_rumor_5|Bugger off! We don't need your sort around here, the orcs are bad enough.
str_dwarf_rumor_6|Who are you calling short?
str_dwarf_rumor_7|You should see the caves of Hornburg. If we could only mine all the gems there...
str_dwarf_rumor_8|No word from our brothers in Moria for a while now. I bet they just want to keep all the riches to themselves!
str_dwarf_rumor_9|Elves? What have the elves ever done for us? Ok, healing arts, but besides that? Ok, some smithing techniques, but anything else? Ok, they fight the Shadow, but besides what have they really ever done for us, I ask you?
str_dwarf_rumor_10|A flagon of ale, a roast pig, a girl with a thick beard and I'm happy!
str_dwarf_rumor_11|Well, Brian, I'm opening a mine! What? Ugh? Well, Brian, I'm opening a mine!
str_dwarf_rumor_12|We, Dwarves always build more than one entry into our mines. And then there's the secret ones too.
str_dwarf_rumor_13|Strange are the ways of men.
str_dwarf_rumor_14|Unwearied then were Durin's folk beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, and at the gates the trumpets rang.
str_dwarf_rumor_15|*humms quietly* Kill the Men! Kill the Elves! Save the gold for ourselves!

str_mordor_rumor_19|Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey!
str_mordor_rumor_20|Isengarders? The muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard! It's orc-flesh they eat, I'll warrant.
str_mordor_rumor_21|Mirkwood is in our hands already, but the elves don't know it yet.
str_mordor_rumor_22|Crank up yer spotting if you don't want to get ambushed in Ithilien. Those damn greenhoods...

str_isengard_rumor_2|Horse-men are food! Bubhosh!
str_isengard_rumor_3|Horse-men will get a pike surprise! Ha ha ha!
str_isengard_rumor_4|Saruman has many tricks! Strong steel and fire-stone!
str_isengard_rumor_5|Wild-men stink! But Sharkû is wise. He knows how to use them.
str_isengard_rumor_6|Moria-scum breed olog-hai! Big! Skai!
str_isengard_rumor_7|Wise master make uruk-hai strong!
str_isengard_rumor_8|Warg is faster than horse! Warg eats horse!

str_isengard_rumor_11|Uruk glob ishi krimp shar-kûk.
str_isengard_rumor_12|Burn forest! Make weapons! Kill horse-men!
str_isengard_rumor_13|Keep away from the berserker before he starts chopping us up!
str_isengard_rumor_14|I saw a berserker get speared through by a horse-man lance. He pulled the manling off his horse by the lance through his guts.
str_isengard_rumor_15|I don't trust those little mountain orc swines. Isengarders will win this war, with or without them.
str_isengard_rumor_16|By the White Hand! What's the use of sending mountain-maggots to fight for us, only half-trained! Cursed goblins and orcs of the North!
str_isengard_rumor_17|I'd tickle some prisoners with my knife. Sometimes you need to make those miserable rats squeak!
str_isengard_rumor_18|There's only one thing the maggots and rats of Lugbúrz can do: they can see like gimlets in the dark.
str_isengard_rumor_19|We're cutting down the forest, but many orcs that go in, never come out.
str_isengard_rumor_20|Where there's a whip there's a way.
str_rhun_rumor_begin|Ride like the wind of the steppes!
str_rhun_rumor_2|The Dwarves are greedy and vile. And Dale-men help them exploit and cheat us.
str_rhun_rumor_3|Three wizards came to our lands a while ago. I wonder what they are up to.
str_rhun_rumor_4|Our lands are vast and sparsely populated. But we know how to survive there.
str_rhun_rumor_5|We used to trade with Elves and Dwarves our wine and pipe-weed from the fertile lands. But they cheat and lie!
str_rhun_rumor_6|Our cousins from Khand prefer to fight on foot, but we know being on a horse is better.
str_rhun_rumor_7|We have defeated Gondor legions before, and we will do it again!
str_rhun_rumor_8|We fight to the death! Never retreat, never turn and run! Not a step backwards!
str_rhun_rumor_9|A red dawn has risen in the east. A red dusk awaits the west!
str_rhun_rumor_10|Elven women? Nah. Too fragile!
str_rhun_rumor_11|Each of my sons has already brought me a head of an enemy. And my daughter the testicles of one. Ha ha ha!
str_rhun_rumor_12|Orcs are filthy beasts with no skill or courage. They have no place on the field of battle.
str_rhun_rumor_13|What's best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.
str_dunland_rumor_begin|We won't rest until we are avenged and the strawheads are on their knees!
str_dunland_rumor_2|Rohirrim bastards are friendly with their horses at night! Ha ha ha!
str_dunland_rumor_3|Strawheads will cough out our land! Together with their blood! Gah!
str_dunland_rumor_4|Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers from the North!
str_dunland_rumor_5|They call it Rohan now, but it's our ancestral land! We will avenge our forfathers and chase off the dirty land-thieves.
str_dunland_rumor_6|Don't let the Forgoil catch you, or they will torture and burn you alive!
str_dunland_rumor_7|We are the bloodlust of the wolf and the strength of the boar!
str_dunland_rumor_8|Forgoil think we are savage and stupid. Let's see what they think after their horsemen meet our pikemen.
str_dunland_rumor_9|Isengard's crows will peck out Strawheads' eyes, Dunland's wolves will bite their throats.
str_dunland_rumor_10|I caught and killed a wolf with my bare hands. I will snap a horse-man's neck like a twig! Grrr!
str_dunland_rumor_11|Our chief found an old bronze sword in a barrow. He bent it and threw it in the marsh. Spirits of the hills will be on our side for sure. It is the old way.
str_dunland_rumor_12|My forefathers fought with Freca and later Wulf against the bloodied Forgoil. We remember their courage.
str_beorn_rumor_begin|The woods are vast and all manner of creatures live inside.
str_beorn_rumor_2|Wild bees make the best honey!
str_beorn_rumor_3|Elves of the woods are elusive, but kind. Dwarves from the mountains are loud and cheerful. Men of Dale are hardworking.
str_beorn_rumor_4|We see many strange beasts passing through our lands.
str_beorn_rumor_5|I sleep all night, and I work all day!
str_beorn_rumor_6|Evil is creeping from the mountains yonder.
str_beorn_rumor_7|The great forest is not as it used to be anymore!
str_beorn_rumor_8|The strength of the axe is not in the blade, but in the haft.
str_beorn_rumor_9|We slept through the last winter. What? Yes, you need to eat a lot in the autumn to last through winter like this.
str_beorn_rumor_10|Men of Rohan are our kin, bears are our blood, goblins are our prey!
str_beorn_rumor_11|Turn into bears? Of course we don't. Who told you that? Ha ha ha!
str_beorn_rumor_12|Beorn was a great man. No, not a man, a giant!
str_beorn_rumor_13|*GROWLS*   Do you have any honey?
str_beorn_rumor_14|Don't wander off alone in the mountains! Bears and wolves stay away from larger groups of men. But hunger, or as some say - shadow spirits, may drive them close enough to attack you.
str_lorien_rumor_begin|O Lórien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. 
str_lorien_rumor_2|Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! There is in her and in this land, no evil, unless a man bring it hither himself. Then let him beware!
str_lorien_rumor_3|The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.
str_lorien_rumor_4|Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves, and another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden Wood as in his own house.
str_lorien_rumor_5|Often does hatred hurt itself!
str_lorien_rumor_6|Ancient magic protects Lothlórien, so powerful the Darkness does not yet dare challenge it.
str_lorien_rumor_7|Nathlo i nathal! You are safe within the golden woods. Posto vae - rest now, eat and drink. If you must leave then, carry with you a memory of how Lorien once was.
str_lorien_rumor_8|It is said that the sea calls to everyone, sooner or later. I too shall hear the gulls one day, leave Laurelindórenan for good. I Harthon an lend and. 
str_lorien_rumor_9|Av-'osto - do not be afraid! More than our grey cloaks protect us from the enemy here.
str_imladris_rumor_begin|May the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you.
str_imladris_rumor_2|May the stars shine upon your faces!
str_imladris_rumor_3|He that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.
str_imladris_rumor_4|We must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope it be.
str_imladris_rumor_5|Despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.
str_imladris_rumor_6|Even after the coldest winter flowers do spring. And after the longest night, comes a new dawn.
str_imladris_rumor_7|So many had gathered when last I rode to war. The light of the drawing of our swords was like a fire in a field of reeds. So few have left Imladris now. 
str_imladris_rumor_8|Áva rucë! The Eldar have taken arms to fight the enemy alongside brave Edain once more.  Perhaps for the last time, who knows? We sing of war, of fire and the end of the Night.
str_imladris_rumor_9|I see the men from the East ride under the Dark Lord's banner and it is as though I watched their ancestors again - waves of horsemen shattering upon the gleaming shieldwall of the Last Alliance. If only the memory of Edain was as long as ours.
str_woodelf_rumor_begin|An Elven-maid there was of old, /A shining star by day: /Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, /Her shoes of silver-grey.
str_woodelf_rumor_2|Time does not tarry ever, but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves.
str_woodelf_rumor_3|Darkness and evil creep over these once beautiful woods. Unless they are stopped, they will smother all hope, all light.
str_woodelf_rumor_4|Quick and nimble, quiet and precise, we can yet keep the Darkness at bay. But how much longer?
str_woodelf_rumor_5|Shhh, no dhínen! There may be orcs lurking around. We must be on guard!
str_woodelf_rumor_6|*stares at you, obviously annoyed by your presence*
str_woodelf_rumor_7|Oduleg hi am man theled? We need to know your purpose here. Sorcerer's spies are everywhere.
str_woodelf_rumor_8|Edain of Dale make intricate toys these days! They've learnt much from the Naugrim.
str_woodelf_rumor_9|The shadow of Dol Guldur is spreading. Dark creatures have been seen in the woods, our outposts attacked, hunters disappear and are never seen again. Our patrols now number at least 35 soldiers, we have grown that fearful!
str_dale_rumor_begin|First there was the dragon, now this...
str_dale_rumor_2|As if the orcs coming from the north weren't bad enough, now the hordes from the east are upon us!
str_dale_rumor_3|Ever since the defeat of the dragon, we know how to look for the enemy's weak spot.
str_dale_rumor_4|Easterlings will never make it past us and our dwarven allies.
str_dale_rumor_5|Have you ever seen the sun rise over the Long lake? The colours used to make my heart sing. But now all I see is a red dawn. A bad omen.
str_dale_rumor_6|Dwarves are a bit too attached to treasures. We still don't know what to think of Thorin Oakenshield.
str_dale_rumor_7|The men of Rohan are our cousins and our own language is very similar to theirs.
str_dale_rumor_8|Esgaroth got its name from an Elven word for reeds, because of its reed banks. Did you know that?
str_dale_rumor_9|The dragon was a sort of a monster noone wants to see ever again.
str_dale_rumor_10|Our prosperity comes from trade with the Dwarves and the Elves. But it's hard to bargain with Dwarves. Very little profit there.
str_harad_rumor_begin|The Black Snake will strike swift and deadly.
str_harad_rumor_2|By the Serpent! Our beasts will trample Gondorians into the dirt.
str_harad_rumor_3|Odum vermajál otí verthaba av daranaja-e-jatánus!
str_harad_rumor_4|There is much gold and gems in Gondor. And even more in the lands beyond.
str_harad_rumor_5|We will catch many western weaklings and sacrifice them to the Serpent God.
str_harad_rumor_6|Corsairs have their uses, they sail well, but are rowdy and unclean in appearance and sneaky in behaviour.
str_harad_rumor_7|I'd never set foot on a ship. Corsairs can have all the seas as far as I am concerned.
str_harad_rumor_8|Warriors of Khand are fierce and fearless, but their strategy is too simple.
str_harad_rumor_9|I'm counting on good loot in the West. We were promised it. Then I can return home and run my carpet shop in peace.
str_harad_rumor_10|Keep away from the Mumakil. They are ill-tempered beasts and will squash you in an instant.
str_harad_rumor_11|In Harad we have deserts and jungles, mountains and sea. Our peoples are as diverse as our lands and as numerous as the grains of sand.
str_harad_rumor_12|Many knights from Harondor prefer sabres over straight blades. They're quite good for cutting down running peasants, but you need a spear or a good sword to penetrate strong armour.
str_harad_rumor_13|My blood brother signed up with the Karka - he's a scout now. Riders of 'The Fang' lead a dangerous life, but it is good experience for young hot-headed boys.
str_harad_rumor_14|Don't ever pick a fight with the Lion brotherhood! Their reputation is well earned.
str_harad_rumor_15|I wish we had more weapons made of black iron. Many still have to manage with bronze, some even with wooden clubs and javelins of black glass, running into battle naked.
str_gunda_rumor_begin|Take warm lands from men we come!
str_gunda_rumor_2|Sharkû promised warm caves.
str_gunda_rumor_3|Enough hiding in the cold mountains! Now we march into warm lands of men.
str_gunda_rumor_4|We saw a slimy skulker in our mountain tunnels, but could never catch him. He just disappeared when we got close.
str_gunda_rumor_5|The Isengarders think they're something special because the old man is equipping them.
str_gunda_rumor_6|We will burn the villages of men to keep us warm.
str_gunda_rumor_7|Manlings will feel the frostbite we will bring to them. And afterwards the fire. Ha ha ha!
str_gunda_rumor_8|Azog and Bolg almost defeated dwarves, elves and manlings last time. But bird-monsters and bear-men saved them. *spit*
str_gunda_rumor_9|Dwarf-flesh is tough and stringy. Man-flesh is better.
str_gunda_rumor_10|Bear-men came from the woods and ate Boldush. Bad luck for Boldush! Ha ha ha!
str_gunda_rumor_11|Some moved to Moria, much room there. But also Ghâsh in the deep. Best stay away!
str_moria_rumor_begin|When you hear drums - run and hide!
str_moria_rumor_2|Ghâsh is in the deep!
str_moria_rumor_3|Doom! Doom! Doom! Drums of the deep.
str_moria_rumor_4|Moria is big, but no dwarves hide in it anymore.
str_moria_rumor_5|Dwarves dug too deep. All the better for us. Ha ha ha!
str_moria_rumor_6|Many tunnels in Moria. We don't go to all.
str_moria_rumor_7|Some manlings and dwarves sneaked past our sentries in the mines a while ago. We doubled the watch since.
str_moria_rumor_8|Dwarves will never set foot here again! Ever!
str_moria_rumor_9|When we gather enough troops, we will go and burn down woods of elves.
str_moria_rumor_10|Not much food in Moria. We're hungry. Must catch men and elves!
str_moria_rumor_11|Some go to the forest in the south. None come out.
str_umbar_rumor_begin|All the seas will belong to the black sails!
str_umbar_rumor_2|There's no Gondor ships left to sink, now we go plunder inland.
str_umbar_rumor_3|Umbar is our fate! And it will be Gondor's too.
str_umbar_rumor_4|Gondorians can't sail! They've got land-legs.
str_umbar_rumor_5|We've killed Gondorian kings in the past. Now they don't even have a king for us to kill.
str_umbar_rumor_6|The sneaky Gondorians burned our fleet years ago. Now it's Gondor that'll burn.
str_umbar_rumor_7|Nothing the sea can throw at us frightens a corsair. But we heard some disturbing rumours about abominations on land.
str_umbar_rumor_8|We will spill over Gondor like a giant wave and reclaim our long lost lands.
str_umbar_rumor_9|Haradrim don't drink rum. Did you know that? We like some, to steady the harpoon hand.
str_umbar_rumor_10|I saw some Variags of Khand fighting. I wouldn't want to be facing them in battle. It is a good thing they are on our side.
str_khand_rumor_begin|A fight is a fight, no matter how bloody. But retreat is the greatest shame!
str_khand_rumor_2|Our swords once drawn, must have blood!
str_khand_rumor_3|The ground trembles under our heavy cataphract cavalry, but our enemies tremble at the mere mention of us!
str_khand_rumor_4|This time we left the Wainriders behind, our attack will catch the enemies off guard.
str_khand_rumor_5|We are the Variags of Khand, the fiercest warriors anywhere!
str_khand_rumor_6|Rhun warriors are fierce too, but they fight on horseback, we rather maul our enemies on foot.
str_khand_rumor_7|We have fought Gondorians in the past, this time we will finish them for good!
str_khand_rumor_8|The West is weak and decadent. They have no warrior spirit. They will fall to our swords and axes.
str_khand_rumor_9|We do not fight for gold or slaves, we fight for honour and glory!
str_khand_rumor_10|The men of the West are arrogant, they do not know what might they are facing!
str_khand_rumor_11|We trade with Rhun, Mordor and Harad. And sometimes we fight them too. It is the way of our people.
str_khand_rumor_12|Have you made your warrior mask yet? You'll need one soon! If the enemy can't see your face, his spirit won't be able to find you.
str_good_rumor_begin|From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
str_good_rumor_2|Orcs fight better at night but are weaker by day.
str_good_rumor_3|Urukhai are a different breed of orc that doesn't fear sunlight!
str_good_rumor_4|Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again.
str_good_rumor_5|The Dead Marshes... a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing.
str_good_rumor_6|The Shadow that bred can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don't think it gave life to the orcs, it only ruined them and twisted them.
str_good_rumor_7|Greenwood it used to be called and full of elves it was. Greatest of the forests of the Northern world. But now it's Mirkwood. Crawling with all manner of evil creatures.
str_good_rumor_8|The Argonath, The Pillars of the Kings, great guardians of the old northern border of Gondor.
str_good_rumor_9|Amon Hen is the westernmost of the three peaks at the southern end of Nen Hithoel.
str_neutral_rumor_begin|Tomorrow everything could change...
str_neutral_rumor_2|Dead Marshes... a place defiled and diseased.
str_neutral_rumor_3|The land used to be much different once.
str_neutral_rumor_4|Stay clear of Fangorn forest.
str_evil_rumor_begin|Orcs fight better at night, men fight better by day.
str_evil_rumor_2|Fight horseman with pike, footman with arrow and archer with shield!
str_evil_rumor_3|Large statues of weaklings on the big river will not stand much longer.
str_legendary_rumor_begin|Legend says that trees meet to talk in Fangorn.
str_legendary_rumor_amonhen|They say there is a special place on the Anduin, somewhere where the big statues stand.
str_legendary_rumor_deadmarshes|It is rumoured all dead seems alive in the middle of Dead Marshes.
str_legendary_rumor_mirkwood|Creatures other than orcs crawl around Mirkwood.
str_legendary_rumor_fangorn|Fangorn is a forest best avoided. Unusual things happen there.
str_last_rumor|I haven't heard anything interesting lately.
str_ent_rumor_begin|Do not be hasty now...
str_ent_rumor_2|Learn now the lore of Living Creatures! First name the four, the free peoples: Eldest of all, the elf-children; Dwarf the delver, dark are his houses; Ent the earthborn, old as mountains; Man the mortal, master of horses.
str_ent_rumor_3|The Old Entish is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.
