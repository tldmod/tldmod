dlga_start:hd_defense_01|It is well that you are here, {playername}. My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I am the Heir of Isildur – see, here is Anduril, the Flame of the West, which I bear in battle. The Blade that was Broken shines again! It will not be long before Saruman’s forces reach these walls. I ask you now to lend me your aid and defend the Rohirrim, for the honour of the Lord of the Mark. Let this be the hour when we draw swords together!
dlga_start:hd_defense_01.1|Mae lovannen! Things here look ill, {playername}, but less ill now that you are here with us! Gellon len covad. I am Legolas of Mirkwood, and though I do not much like this place I like the approaching hordes of Saruman even less. What would I give for a hundred more of my kin here! There are too few of us, too few. We shall need your aid, Commander, though we may be but a few leaves in the forest. Come, let me show you where our bows will be of the most use…
dlga_start:hd_defense_01.2|Right glad am I to see you, kinsman! I am Gimli, son of Gloin. It is a great host that comes now against us, but my axe is restless in my hand, and I know you feel the same! Give us a row of orc-necks to hew and room to swing, and together we shall teach them the meaning of fear. Stout feet and hard axes, that is what will carry us through the night! Ai oi! There are enough for both of us. Baruk Khazaˆd! Khazaˆd ai-meˆnu!
dlga_hd_defense_01:close_window|Now, let us rest for a while. The enemy will be here by nightfall.
dlga_start:aragorn_thanks_hd|{playername}, I am glad to see you live still. The men are weary with battle, but thanks to you they see the dawn of a new day. The hillmen have given themselves up, and they shall be put to work to repair the evil which they have joined, after which I hope they will return to their own lands. They were easily deceived by Saruman, for much was taken from them, and much remains to be given back; we shall have to see what can be done for them later.
dlga_aragorn_thanks_hd:close_window|I hope our paths may cross again, {playername}. I bid you farewell now, for I ride on an errand most urgent. With the first light of morning we must go, my friends and I, and take a dark road out of this valley. {playername}, the times are evil, but your valour gladdens the hearts of all free peoples everywhere, from the North to the South. Fight well, and we may meet again beyond the shadows!
dlga_start:close_window.1|In a little while I take the road again, {playername}, a hard road untrodden by many for uncounted years. I hope your path is easier than mine, friend. In the meantime, perhaps you may wish to go into the deep Caverns of Helm's Deep, of which my companion Gimli the Dwarf has spoken much.
dlga_start:close_window.2|Have you yet been to the caves in the back? The Glittering Caves of Aglarond, {playername}! Happy is the chance that has led your footsteps here!
dlga_start:close_window.3|I have pledged to my friend Gimli Gloin's son that when the war is over, I shall return here with him and see the Glittering Caves of Aglarond for myself.

dlga_start:treebeard_isengard_1|{s2} Ha, hmmm! Welcome, friends! Your arrival is timely. I have a Wizard to manage here, but first, we must nail him down in his tower. This will be a nasty business. Rock, axe and fire await us inside. Will you help us?

dlga_start:close_window.5|Thank you for your help. I must say it was quite satisfying to manage those Orcs. You were of great help to us. But now, hm, we have work to do that you cannot help with. You should maybe find a safe spot outside Isengard and wait until we are finished.
dlga_start:treebeard_isengard_3|Hello again. It is good to see you safe and dry. I must say it will take a long while to flush all of Saruman's filth away. But we’ve done quite well, hmm, yes. He will do no more harm.
dlga_treebeard_isengard_3:close_window|Ho, hmm, I owe you great thanks. I had not expected any help from others, and it is good to learn that our Last March may not end quite so badly, after all! Since the tree-killer is dealt with, we should now be able to keep Rohan's northern marches safe, for a while.
dlga_treebeard_isengard_3:close_window.1|Hmm? Ho, hmm… ah. So, you have come all the way from Rohan, have you? Hmm. I have heard some news from the south, yes. Good news, news to gladden all hearts. I have good will to Theoden King, and I am glad he was aided by the likes of you in his hour of peril, hmm! We have managed here well enough, and now we Ents will see to it that Saruman does not set foot beyond Isengard, without our leave. The Isen flows well again, and soon I hope the water will once more be fit to drink. Ha, hm, I feel a song coming on. A song of the old days… the old trees I knew…

dlga_ent_encounter:close_window|Hail, tree shepherd! Thank you for keeping these marshes safe. I will not stand in your way.
dlga_start:treebeard_introduce_1|(You find that you are looking at a most extraordinary creature. He is very tall and stiff-limbed with bark-like skin and leafy hair. Moss is also covering parts of his body. But at the moment you are noting little but the eyes. The deep eyes are surveying you, slow and solemn but very sharp and penetrating. You think they are brown, shot with green light, as if there is an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking. But on the surface his eyes are sparkling with the present... like the sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or the ripples of a very deep lake.)

With a very deep, slow and booming voice he very slowly expounds in a most commanding way:)^  'Hrooom... Hmmm... *I* am not going to tell you my name... not yet at any rate. For one thing it would take a long while. My name is growing all the time and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time saying anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.'

dlga_treebeard_about_ents:treebeard_pretalk|Hrooom... We are shepherds of the Trees and we protect them from perils. We are older than any of the mortal races but not as old as the Elves who cured us from dumbness. Things have changed over the ages. In the beginning we were more hasty and flexible. Over time many of us have been lost. Some of us are still true Ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but many are half awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, well getting Entish. That is going on all the time. When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. Still, we do what we can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.

Usually, capitals will be sieged last.^- If a faction loses their capital, they will be defeated.^- Factions gain strength from victories in the field and from holding certain key settlements.^- Factions lose strength from defeats in the field or from losing settlements.^- Some quests or events can affect faction strength.^- You can compare the current faction strength ratings in the 'Reports' menu.^- See the Info Pages for more TLD guides.

dlga_lord_talk:dwarf_lord_book|{s3}, I have a matter which I must bring to your attention.
dlga_dwarf_lord_book:dwarf_lord_book_give|Speak freely, {playername}.
dlga_dwarf_lord_book_give:dwarf_lord_book_give_a|I ventured deep into the Mines of Moria and found record of Balin's company.

dlga_dwarf_lord_book_give_b:dwarf_lord_book_give_c|I'm afraid it is. I'd have searched further but I was beset by goblins, and in great number. I bring only this...

dlga_dwarf_lord_book_give_d:dwarf_lord_book_give_e|So it is as I feared. I had counseled Balin against this expedition but he was resolved. A fool I was for giving him leave to go.

dlga_lord_talk:tell_dorwinion_sack|My lord, I found a sack with a fading emblem of grapes and some shards of wood and metal inside that could have belong to a spear.
dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack:tell_dorwinion_sack_2|Very interesting. This ancient sack could have born the mark of the finest wines that could only come from Dorwinion.
dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack_2:tell_dorwinion_sack_3|I also found this Rhun helm in the sack. Could this tell us more about what happened to the Spears?
dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack_3:lord_pretalk|Caravans are often robbed along the way. That helm is from a Rhun Scout.

dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunters_start|My lord, I am prepared to take more arduous tasks to serve you better and end this war. What would you have me do?
dlga_ring_hunters_start:ring_hunters_check|{playername}, you have done great deeds and proven yourself worthy of the task I will now request of you. I trust you to deal with this matter as best you see fit, but know that our foe is dangerous and bloodshed will be unavoidable. Is your company strong enough for battle?
dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_1|Yes, my lord. I have a group of well-trained, battlehardened men. We are ready for anything.
dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_check_failed|I am afraid not, my lord.
dlga_ring_hunters_check_failed:lord_pretalk|Then you are not ready for this task yet,{playername}. Go and gather more troops.
dlga_ring_hunters_1:ring_hunters_2|Excellent. The North has recently been plagued by a marauding band of outlaws, who raid villages and ambush travellers searching for rings of any kind   You are to hunt these bandits down and put an end to their quest. Survivors of their last pillaging have reported two groups.   The first is returning with their loot to their encampment on the eaves of Mirkwood. The other, advances towards Beorn's House in great numbers, and I fear what may happen if they are left unimpeded.
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_what|My lord, what could they be searching for?
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_accept|My lord, I will do what is necessary to stop these... 'Ring Hunters'
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_reject|I am not ready for such a task just yet.
dlga_ring_hunters_accept:close_window|With bravery in your heart and sharp steel in your hands you will, {playername}. We will await news of your success.
dlga_ring_hunters_reject:lord_pretalk|I see. Let me know when you are, but make haste, we do not want them to succeed.
dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2|Designs of the Enemy are hidden from us, but we can see thes ruffians are bent on finding what they are looking for.  I cannot reveal all that we know, for much hangs in the balance and secrecy is paramount. Whatever they seek must be a powerful weapon, one to be used to cause more destruction in the Dark Lord's name.
dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2.1|The Dark Lord previously sent emissaries to different dwarven clans, asking about the rings of power given to our people. These bandits may be looking for them, or others like them...   Whether true or not, they must not fall into the Dark Lord's hands.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_party_defeated|My lord, I come bearing ill news... Though I have defeated the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, their leaders were not there. They may have found what they were looking for
dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated:ring_hunter_party_defeated2|This is not ill news,{playername}. We have heard of your great victory! The lives of those villagers matter more to our cause than any weapon. As we speak, the Beornings are amassing their strength, invigorated by your victory.     Moreover, we don't believe that these Ring Hunters found what they are looking for. If it was the weapon we feared, then we would have felt something... a disturbance.
dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated2:ring_hunter_quest_end|I am glad, then. Whatever this weapon may have been... they may still be looking for it. I will remain vigilant and remain on the lookout for more of these Ring Hunters.
dlga_ring_hunter_quest_end:close_window|We all will. Thank you once more for your service, {playername}.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf|My lord, though I was unable to intercept the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, I was able to defeat their leaders in their lair. They had this in their possession.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf:ring_hunter_lair_defeated|I see, a ring, but not THE ring. Not even one of the great rings, yet not a mere trinket either. There is some power woven into it.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated:ring_hunter_lair_defeated2|Then we were right to snatch it from the Dark Lord’s fingers, before he could use it to spread his Shadow over the land and have it seep into the hearts of many.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated2:ring_hunter_lair_quest_end|You must keep this ring and use it to fight the Enemy and his armies. I trust you to use it well.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_quest_end:close_window|This is an honour, my Lord, thank you! My heart will stay true and my arm strong.

dlga_start:beorn_message|My {lord/lady}, we received a warning from {s1} that a large outlaw warband was headed our way! Alas, there was no time to gather enough warriors. Having heard the sound of battle, we prepared for the worst!
dlga_beorn_message:beorn_message2|That was no band of ordinary outlaws. They were the Dark Lord's worst of the worst, at least here in the North. Their leaders, however, were not here. Their den lies near Mirkwood Forest and I must make haste.
dlga_beorn_message2:beorn_message_end|Yes, we were warned about the camp also and sent scouts towards it. We saw them burn it down and swiftly ride towards Mordor. If you chose to rush there first, you may not have been able to help us. We are truly grateful for your victory!
dlga_beorn_message_end:beorn_message_close|I must report back and tell {s1} about the battle. Go back to your village and dispatch scouts. There may be stragglers.

I grow tired.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_lend_companion_end|Oh, you want your companion back? I see...
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_pretalk|{playername}, I must beg your patience, I still have need of your companion. Please return later when things have settled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg1} prisoners.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank_extra|Why, I have brought you {reg2} prisoners, in case {reg1} are not enough.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.1|Indeed. I have rescued {reg1} allied prisoners and they joined my party.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.2|Indeed. I have scouted {s13}.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.3|Indeed. I have dispatched the scouts.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.4|Indeed. I have defeated enough enemy parties.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:capture_enemy_hero_thank|Oh, indeed. I've captured an enemy commander for you.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank:capture_enemy_hero_thank_2|Many thanks, my friend. He will serve very well for questioning. You've done a fine work here.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Certainly, {s65}.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_raise_troops_thank|Indeed. I have raised {reg1} {s13}. You can take them.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_raise_troops_thank.1|Indeed. I have trained {reg2} troops, and {reg1} of them have learned well. You can take them, they should be more prepared for battle.

dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank_2:lord_pretalk|{s4}
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success|I found {s4} hiding in {s3} and gave him his punishment.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail|I'm afraid he got away.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2|And we'll all be a lot better off without him! Thank you, {playername},  for removing this long-festering thorn from my side. 'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things  with an appropriate level of tactfulness.  I've sent a note to our intendants already, and you can count on additional supplies from us.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:lord_pretalk|I'll notify our intendants of your service, {playername}. Once again, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s44}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:lord_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s44} manages to avoid my grasp yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
dlga_lord_mission_failed:lord_pretalk|{s43}
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk|You still haven't finished the last task I gave you, {playername}. You should be working on that, not asking me for other things to do.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.1|I don't have any other task for you right now.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_capture_troll_1|You are a brave servant, {playername}, and we will give you a glimpse of our plans. We need fresh monstrous blood and flesh. We need it to twist it and bend it and torture it and tame it and reshape it and breed it, to forge and strengthen our own breeds of colossal warriors!
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_1:lord_mission_capture_troll_2|How can I serve, Master?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_2:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|A wild cave troll, {playername}. Capture one strong exemplar for me and bring it to me, alive. We need one more of them for Our experiments! Two, would be better. The more we have, the better.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa|Where can such a beast be found?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infob|How can such a beast be captured?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc|How can such a beast be transported to you?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted|You shall have your wild troll, Master.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected|Mercy, Master! That beast will smash me like a bug!
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|In these time of blood and shadows, wild cave trolls are growing excited and they are spreading from their lairs in the Misty Mountains... the best place where to look would be around the caves there.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infob:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You shall find one, and take it down in combat. Fear not of killing it during the fight: a troll is too coriaceous a beast for your weapons to kill it right away... and they do recover, more than you would expect. After it falls over its own black blood, you shall carry it to our feet, still breathing.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You will be provided with a robust wheeled cage. It harbours more than enough space for a troll, and it can be pulled around. Hasten your steps on the way back: not even the metal of the cage is totally safe against the fury of a troll blinded by rage and pain. Make sure it does not break free and kill you.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected:lord_pretalk|Only now you reveal what you are really worth, but I knew that of you all along. Weak, coward {playername}. Now begone.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted:lord_pretalk|I knew I could count on your strength and bravery. Slaves, give to {playername} one of our wheeled cages! {playername}, return when you have my gift. I want it before {reg1} dawns are passed.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_kill_troll|Our land is facing dangers that were unheard of in our times. People are disappearing in the outskirts of {s3}. Not only commoners, but even small armed groups who venture outside the walls never return. There have been the strangest rumors, but I know what we are facing.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_kill_troll:lord_mission_told|Wild trolls, {playername}. Giant beasts, twisted montrousities. They never ventured so far from their dark caves in the mountains but at least one of them have been sighted around {s3}. I don't know what witchery has caused this, but I need that thing to be dispatched.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a|How can those beasts be fought?
dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a:lord_mission_told|A troll is a dangerous creature indeed. A giant monster which possesses an incredible strength in its deformed muscles. Their skin is as hard as iron, and a tree trunk is but a small club when wielded in their hands. It is rumored that a single troll can easily best a group of half a dozen well armed and trained men, wasting each of them with a single blow. Not only men but horses too fear trolls. Be careful if you plan to charge one while mounted.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b|Do you think it comes from Mordor, or Isengard?
dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b:lord_mission_told|No, I don't think so. We have news that both the White Wizard and the Black Tower have all kinds of monsters among their ranks, but from what I hear the beast terrifying {s3} is one savage, untamed beast. Remember, there could be more than one. But you can be sure that some obscure craft from the Enemy has led this new plague upon us.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave servant like you, {playername}. The strangest rumors reach my ears from the forest of Fangorn. Minions sent to harvest wood, and even my commanders traversing the place, occasionally fail to return. Other times, they report of mysterious losses among their troops. They blame ghosts, spirits of the wood, ancient curses... Nonsense! Puny excuses for their own cowardice or ineptitude!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1|What do you command me to do about it, Master?
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|But Master, there is danger and pain in Fangorn! I've felt it myself!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2|Maybe it is just that my other servants are unable to prevent the most cowardly worms in their troops from deserting.  Fools, blinded by superstitions.   Or, maybe, it is the treacherous ambushes of elven scum, hiding in the putrid trees as they usually do.   It could even be lowborn traitors from Rohan.  Or who knows what else. I want you to find out, {playername}.
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted|I fear no elves or spirit. Leave this to me, Master.
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|Master, pity your servant! Don't ask me to venture in that cursed place!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected:lord_pretalk|So you are like the other worms: a superstitious, worthless coward.  I overestimated you. Now, begone!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good. Go there and shed some light on this matter. Then return to me and report. I expect to see you back with news before {reg1} dawns are passed.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_find_lost_spears|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave commander like you, {playername}. We are ill equipped to fight off the Rhun hordes. Our armies are losing battles one by one. A legend tells that once upon a time, there were spears made by Dwarves for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for..
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1|What do you command me to do about it, my lord?
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2|These weapons would increase the effectiveness of our armies, but above all they will lift the spirits of our men. You'll have to find these spears. You'll have to go ask the dwarves for permission to search for the spears in the deeps of the Lonely Mountain. Beware, you may encounter some orcs or trolls in the tunnels. Are you available for this task?
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_accepted|I fear no orcs nor trolls! I will find these spears for you, my lord.
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_rejected|I'm afraid I can't help you, my lord.
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_rejected:lord_pretalk|I see that discretion is the better part of your valor. Maybe you should stick to scouting duties.
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good luck then!
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer|There is an important service you can deliver to our people, {playername}.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0|My power to defend and preserve Lothlorien has been diminished by the devices of the enemy. A master sorcerer of Dol Guldur is invoking powerful charms that inhibit our defenses. Though he is a mortal, he has become one of the enemies greatest pupils in the use of arcane rituals and he represents a great threat to our people. You must hunt him down and destroy him!
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1|Where can I find the sorcerer, my Lady?
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2|Search for him in Mirkwood forest, not far from Dol Guldur itself. He is both a well guarded and a cautious foe so you will need to use stealth to prevent the alarm from being raised. If he escapes, he will relocate to other dark places that we know not of and continue his wickedness unchallenged. There will be only one opportunity to defeat him. Much depends on your success. Go with our blessings.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_pretalk|As you command, my Lady. I will try my best to eliminate this evil.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected|Forgive me, my Lady. I have some pressing matters to attend before I can help your people with this endevour.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected:lord_pretalk|I understand, {playername}. But do not tally for too long, for the effort of resisting his magic is wearying me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is an urgent matter... My messenger is due to report on our battle plans to commanders in {s14}. His trip has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time he must get through. So, I want to at least make sure he's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort him to {s14} and make sure he arrives safe and sound.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound,and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die. This man is dear to me, {playername},but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here.I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look,{reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation.Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request.

dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted|Of course, {s65}. Give me {reg1} fresh recruits and I'll train them to be {s14}.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate_1|I suggest another method, {s65}. I'll take {reg1} fresh recruits to the training fields teach them a thing or two...
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate_1:lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate|I suggest another method, {s65}.... I'll take {reg1} fresh recruits to the training fields teach them a thing or two. They won't become {s14} afterwards, but this is one step towards that.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected|I am too busy these days to train anyone.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You've taken a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command. Also, I'll advance you some money to help with expenses. Here, this purse should do it. Thank you for your help.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_alternate:close_window|This is an interesting proposal, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send the recruits to the training field. Follow them there, and whip them up to shape. I will be watching. Thank you for your help.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my bodyguards and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. There has been news recently that the fugitive has been seen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and deliver him swift justice, and I'll reward you in turn.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.

dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|There are refugees on their way to {s6}. They will be moving slow, and as such, is a moving target to our enemies. Defend them until they reach their destination.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.3|Our spies tell us that there are refugees on their way to {s6}. They will be slow because of all the old, the sick, and the dying. Hunt them down, kill all the men, and take everyone else as slaves. Make sure none arrive at their destination!
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.4|Well, some of the slaves working in {s4} have run away.  The ungrateful swine, whose lives we spared!  From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands now, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the one who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the enemy commanders and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to question him on the enemy battle plans.

dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_choose_mode|I'm ready for training.
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
dlga_trainer_choose_mode:trainer_choose_mode_player|We have several training modes to improve our soldiers' skills. Single combat will pit you against one to four opponents, in team combat your team of four will face four, eight or twelve combatants, and, finally, Gauntlet is the ultimate challenge for any warrior - you'll face waves of increasing number of opponents all by yourself.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|A task, you say? Actually I am looking for someone to supply us with ore and metals. Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.6|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}.
