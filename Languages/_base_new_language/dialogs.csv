Moss is also covering parts of his body. But at the moment you are noting little but the eyes. The deep eyes are surveying you, slow and solemn but very sharp and penetrating. You think they are brown, shot with green light, as if there is an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking. But on the surface his eyes are sparkling with the present... like the sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or the ripples of a very deep lake.)

For one thing it would take a long while. My name is growing all the time and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say.

Over time many of us have been lost. Some of us are still true Ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but many are half awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, well getting Entish. That is going on all the time. When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. Still, we do what we can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.

dlga_start:lord_start.3|Well, {playername}...
dlga_lord_start:lord_start|{s42}
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed|Your surgeon managed to convince my friend and made the operation.  All we can do now is pray for his recovery. Anyway, I thank you for lending your surgeon to me, {playername}. You have a noble spirit. I will not forget it.
dlga_lord_start:lord_investigate_fangorn_completed0|So, {playername}, you return from Fangorn. What did you find out?
dlga_lord_investigate_fangorn_completed0:lord_investigate_fangorn_completed1|The trees are alive! They assault our troops!
dlga_lord_investigate_fangorn_completed1:close_window|I suspected that all along. You have been of good service to me, {playername}.
dlga_lord_start:close_window|My patience is over. I was expecting you to tell me something about Fangorn by now, but you know nothing.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls|Master, I hereby give you not one, but a pair of beasts!
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_capture_troll_completed_one_troll|Master, I subjugated the beast you have asked for!
dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls:lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou|Two beasts! Excellent, {playername}. You proved worthy, and skill and dedication must be rewarded. With your two trolls, We can now make without one of those We were using for Our experiments. It is a fully trained slave, ready to fight under command. We mean YOUR command, {playername}.

dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou_info:lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou|Are you questioning the abilities of your Master, {playername}? This beast is trained to attack enemies on sight. This is enough. But, you and your warriors keep at due distance from the beast when it fights, and never stand between it and its victims.
dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou_accept:lord_pretalk|Now bring havoc to my enemies with your new gift
dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou_refuse:lord_pretalk|As you wish, then. Someone else among of my servants will known how to use this mighty tool of war.
dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou_raise:lord_pretalk|You dare ask for an fully armoured battle troll, {playername}, to keep under your command? That's not a small thing to ask for. But you are a skilled servant, and we know your motivations. We like that. It shall be granted.
dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou_raise:lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou|How dare you ask Us for more than We have planned for you in our great Wisdom? {playername}, you proved a mighty Servant today, but don't let your insolence test Our patience any further.
dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_one_troll:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. You are a most faithful and useful servant. This troll will be most useful for our purposes. That it is taken to the dungeons!
dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|Too long ago, I asked you to take me one troll alive. But I should have known. How could I expect someone like {playername} to be up to the challenge. My servant was not skilled or faithful enough.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|News of your accomplishment against the wild trolls reached me. {s12} has one fear less to worry about, thanks to you, {playername}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Our scouts near {s12} have told us about your success. This will teach them from spying on us.^^The destruction of this camp will surely halt our enemies' advance.
dlga_lord_start:destroy_scout_camp_failed|Our scouts near {s12} saw you and your men retreat. This is disappointing, {playername}. ^^Your failure resulted in the attack of vital supply lines. It will take some time to recover.
dlga_destroy_scout_camp_failed:close_window|I will do better next time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.3|We have heard from our scouts near {s12} that you have valiantly defended the village. These raiders are becoming bolder every day... ^^We sense that war is surely coming. Thank you once more, {playername}.
dlga_lord_start:defend_village_failed|We have heard from our scouts near {s12} that you have failed to defend the village. The villagers were either slaughtered or made into slaves. These raiders are becoming bolder every day... ^^We sense that war is surely coming.
dlga_defend_village_failed:close_window|I will do better next time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.4|We saw the flames coming from the village near {s12}. We heard the screams. This is only the beginning, {playername}. ^^War is coming.
dlga_lord_start:raid_village_failed|We saw some of your men running away from the village near {s12}. You dare come back here and show your face, {playername}?. ^^There will be war, but with failures like this, you may be its first casualty.
dlga_raid_village_failed:close_window|I will do better next time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|{s4}
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.5|Damn me, but you've done it, {playername}. All the slaves are back and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my slaves, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple animals, or are you merely incompetent?
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those slaves were slippery as eels.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to capture new men to work these fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of slaves that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the slaves you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|Ah, {playername}. I am pleased that you delivered {reg13} units of {s4}, as I requested. I'm impressed.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me your reports of the mission to {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, sir.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are dwindling too quickly, {playername}. I need you to bring me {reg3} units of {s4} so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted|Very well, I can find you some {s4}.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected|Sorry, sir, I have other plans.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! You know what to do, {playername}, now get to it. I need that food sooner rather than later.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That . . . is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now, I've work to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope you have brought with you troops of sufficient number and experience.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_completed|I have a company of good, hardened soldiers with me. We are ready to join you.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_continue|I don't have the sufficient number of troops yet. I will need some more time.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. I will send the word when I have a task for you. For the moment, just follow us and stay close. We'll be moving soon.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking in information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, sir.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I fear I must decline.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good! Simply pass near {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.

dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|Well, he is all yours.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I fear I have other plans for him.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_accept:lord_pretalk|Excellent! I'll send my men to take him to our prison with due haste. This will surely help our cause.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_deny:lord_pretalk|Too bad, he would have been precious for us, {playername}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Ah, welcome, {s24}.^You should already know that {s12}. Your duty is to help in our struggle, {playername}. When you prove yourself worthy of my confidence [level {reg1}], I will also allow you access to that chest over there.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk|What is it?
dlga_lord_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_lend_companion_end|I should like {s14} returned to me, {s65}, if you no longer require {reg3?her:his} services.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk|You've too many men in your company already, {playername}. You could not lead any more at the moment.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk.1|Certainly, {playername}. {reg3?She:He} is a bright {reg3?girl:fellow}, you're a lucky commander to have such worthy companions.

dlga_lord_talk:find_lost_spears_permission|My lord, I wish to enter into the lonely mountains, in search of King Bladorthin's lost spears.
dlga_find_lost_spears_permission:lord_pretalk|I already gave you permission, {playername}.
dlga_find_lost_spears_permission:find_lost_spears_permission_yes|Alright, {playername}, you may enter into the mountains.
dlga_find_lost_spears_permission:lord_pretalk.1|I'm sorry, but I don't know or trust you well enough, {playername}.
dlga_find_lost_spears_permission_yes:lord_pretalk|I thank you, my Lord.
dlga_lord_talk:tell_dorwinion_sack|My lord, I found a sack with a fading emblem of grapes and some shards of wood and metal inside that could have belong to a spear.
dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack:tell_dorwinion_sack_2|Very interesting. This ancient sack could have born the mark of the finest wines that could only come from Dorwinion.
dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack_2:tell_dorwinion_sack_3|I also found this Rhun helm in the sack. Could this tell us more about what happened to the Spears?
dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack_3:lord_pretalk|Caravans are often robbed along the way. That helm is from a Rhun Scout. Follow the river down south to the Sea of Rhun and search the trade routes to Dorwinion and you may find what you are looking for. NOTE: THIS QUEST IS NOT YET COMPLETED. TO BE CONTINUED.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunters_start|My lord, I am prepared to take more arduous tasks to serve you better and end this war. What would you have me do?
dlga_ring_hunters_start:ring_hunters_check|{playername}, I have heard of your exploits and you have made a name for yourself. I have a task specifically for such as yourself. You can deal with it however you wish.  Bloodshed cannot be avoided, especially against this group I am about to send you of to. Do you have sufficient men?
dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_1|Yes, my lord. I have a group of well-trained, battlehardened men. We are ready for anything.
dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_check_failed|I am afraid not, my lord.
dlga_ring_hunters_check_failed:lord_pretalk|Then you are not ready for this task yet,{playername}. Go and gather more troops.
dlga_ring_hunters_1:ring_hunters_2|Excellent. The North has recently been plagued by a marauding band of outlaws, who raid villages and ambush travellers searching for rings of any kind   You are to hunt these bandits down and put an end to their quest. Survivors of their last pillaging have reported two groups.   One with their loot moving towards Mirkwood Forest. The other, a considerable size, towards Beorn's House, perhaps to continue their destructive search.
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_what|My lord, what could they be searching for?
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_accept|My lord, I will do what is necessary to stop these... 'Ring Hunters'
dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_reject|I am not ready for such a task just yet.
dlga_ring_hunters_accept:close_window|You are brave, General. We will await news of your success
dlga_ring_hunters_reject:lord_pretalk|I see. Let me know when you are, but make haste, we do not want them to succeed.
dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2|It is hard to know exactly what they want with this, but we can see that they are going through great lengths to find what they are looking for.   All we can surmise is that this must be a powerful weapon of sorts, a weapon to be used to cause more destruction under the Dark Lord's name.
dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2.1|The Dark Lord previously sent emissaries to different dwarven clans, asking about the rings of power given to our people. These bandits may be looking for these..   Whether true or not, these must not fall into the Dark Lord's hands.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_party_defeated|My lord, I come bearing ill news.. Though I have defeated the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, their leaders were not there. They may have found what they were looking for
dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated:ring_hunter_party_defeated2|This is not ill news,{playername}. We have heard of your great victory! The lives of those villagers matter more to our cause than any weapon. As we speak, the Beornings are amassing their strength, invigorated by your victory.     Moreover, we don't believe that these Ring Hunters found what they are looking for. If it was the weapon we feared, then we would have felt something.. a disturbance.
dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated2:ring_hunter_quest_end|I am glad, then. Whatever this weapon may have been... they may still be looking for it. I will remain vigilant and remain on the lookout for more of these Ring Hunters.
dlga_ring_hunter_quest_end:close_window|We all will. Thank you once more for your service, {playername}.
dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf|My lord, though I was unable to intercept the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, I was able defeat their leaders in their lair. I also came across this
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf:ring_hunter_lair_defeated|This is a minor ring of power.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated:ring_hunter_lair_defeated2|Then we have prevented the Dark Lord from obtaining this, which he will undoubtly use to end more lives.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated2:ring_hunter_lair_quest_end|You must keep this ring and use against the Dark Lord's forces. We know you will use it well.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_quest_end:close_window|This is a tremendous honour, my Lord. Thank you. I shall continue the battle against the Dark lord, and this will help tremendously.
dlga_start:ring_hunters_party_attack|Look here, men. Another group to slaughter.
dlga_ring_hunters_party_attack:ring_hunters_party_attack_2|Your rampaging has come to an end.
dlga_ring_hunters_party_attack_2:close_window|Everyone, make sure you search their packs and their fingers. Save one to torture. Everything else you can eat.
dlga_start:ring_hunter_lair_defeat|That ring belongs to the Dark Lord! You can not have it!
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeat:ring_hunter_lair_defeat2|This belongs to me now.
dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeat2:close_window|This defeat does not matter... our war party raged on! You are too late to save them!
dlga_start:beorn_message|General, we received a message from {s1} that a large bandit party was headed our way! We had no time to gather enough forces, and when we heard the sound of battle, we prepared for the worse!
dlga_beorn_message:beorn_message2|That was no ordinary bandit party. They were a collection of the Dark Lord's best...however, their leaders were not here...They have a lair near Mirkwood Forest and I must make haste.
dlga_beorn_message2:beorn_message_end|Yes, the message mentioned the lair and we sent scouts towards it. We saw them burn it down and leave towards Mordor...If you went there first, you may not have been able to help us. We are truly grateful for your victory
dlga_beorn_message_end:beorn_message_close|Then I must report back and tell {s1} what has transpired here. Go back to your village and prepare scouts. There may be stragglers.
dlga_beorn_message_close:close_window|Yes, General. We will remain vigilant. We will continue our efforts to recruit more men from surrounding villages. Your victory today has inspired us all.

dlga_lord_mission_defend_village_b:lord_mission_defend_question|We can, but it will take time to mobilize. We fear that we may be too late when we do. ^^You and your men seem able to ride out quickly. Can you defend this village?

dlga_lord_mission_defend_reject:close_window|I see. Then I will send what troops I can. Let us hope we are not too late.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_raid_village_a|{playername}, there is a village nearby that is ripe for the picking.

dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_mission_sorcerer_completed|The sorcerer of Mirkwood has been slain, my Lady.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_mission_sorcerer_failed|Forgive me, my Lady, but urgent matters have prevented me from slaying the sorcerer, and in the meantime he has fled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_mission_sorcerer_failed.1|The sorcerer of Mirkwood still lives. We interrupted his rituals but he has fled.
dlga_lord_mission_sorcerer_completed:lord_pretalk|Yes {playername}, I had sensed his death. The veil of sorcery has been lifted from the wood and much of my power has returned. You have performed a great service for our people and as such you are entitled to a gift. Take this...
dlga_lord_mission_sorcerer_failed:lord_pretalk|Yes {playername}, I sense the dark arts of enemy still pressing upon us. His efforts seem greater now. It is unfortunate that you could not stop him. No doubt he will take additional precautions in future to ward against our efforts. He will likely never be found while Dol Guldur still stands. Thank you for your efforts but leave me now. I grow tired.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_lend_companion_end|Oh, you want your companion back? I see...
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_pretalk|{playername}, I must beg your patience, I still have need of your companion. Please return later when things have settled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg1} prisoners.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank_extra|Why, I have brought you {reg2} prisoners, in case {reg1} are not enough.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.1|Indeed. I have rescued {reg1} allied prisoners and they joined my party.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.2|Indeed. I have scouted {s13}.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.3|Indeed. I have dispatched the scouts.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank.4|Indeed. I have defeated enough enemy parties.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:capture_enemy_hero_thank|Oh, indeed. I've captured an enemy commander for you.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank:capture_enemy_hero_thank_2|Many thanks, my friend. He will serve very well for questioning. You've done a fine work here.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Certainly, {s65}.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_raise_troops_thank|Indeed. I have raised {reg1} {s13}. You can take them.

'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things  with an appropriate level of tactfulness.  I've sent a note to our intendants already, and you can count on additional supplies from us.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:lord_pretalk|I'll notify our intendants of your service, {playername}. Once again, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s44}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:lord_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s44} manages to avoid my grasp yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
dlga_lord_mission_failed:lord_pretalk|{s43}
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk|You still haven't finished the last task I gave you, {playername}. You should be working on that, not asking me for other things to do.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.1|I don't have any other task for you right now.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_capture_troll_1|You are a brave servant, {playername}, and we will give you a glimpse of our plans. We need fresh monstrous blood and flesh. We need it to twist it and bend it and torture it and tame it and reshape it and breed it, to forge and strengthen our own breeds of colossal warriors!
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_1:lord_mission_capture_troll_2|How can I serve, Master?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_2:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|A wild cave troll, {playername}. Capture one strong exemplar for me and bring it to me, alive. We need one more of them for Our experiments! Two, would be better. The more we have, the better.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa|Where can such a beast be found?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infob|How can such a beast be captured?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc|How can such a beast be transported to you?
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted|You shall have your wild troll, Master.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected|Mercy, Master! That beast will smash me like a bug!
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|In these time of blood and shadows, wild cave trolls are growing excited and they are spreading from their lairs in the Misty Mountains... the best place where to look would be around the caves there.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infob:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You shall find one, and take it down in combat. Fear not of killing it during the fight: a troll is too coriaceous a beast for your weapons to kill it right away... and they do recover, more than you would expect. After it falls over its own black blood, you shall carry it to our feet, still breathing.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You will be provided with a robust wheeled cage. It harbours more than enough space for a troll, and it can be pulled around. Hasten your steps on the way back: not even the metal of the cage is totally safe against the fury of a troll blinded by rage and pain. Make sure it does not break free and kill you.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected:lord_pretalk|Only now you reveal what you are really worth, but I knew that of you all along. Weak, coward {playername}. Now begone.
dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_accepted:lord_pretalk|I knew I could count on your strength and bravery. Slaves, give to {playername} one of our wheeled cages! {playername}, return when you have my gift. I want it before {reg1} dawns are passed.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_kill_troll|Our land is facing dangers that were unheard of in our times. People are disappearing in the outskirts of {s3}. Not only commoners, but even small armed groups who venture outside the walls never return. There have been the strangest rumors, but I know what we are facing.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_kill_troll:lord_mission_told|Wild trolls, {playername}. Giant beasts, twisted montrousities. They never ventured so far from their dark caves in the mountains but at least one of them have been sighted around {s3}. I don't know what witchery has caused this, but I need that thing to be dispatched.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a|How can those beasts be fought?
dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a:lord_mission_told|A troll is a dangerous creature indeed. A giant monster which possesses an incredible strength in its deformed muscles. Their skin is as hard as iron, and a tree trunk is but a small club when wielded in their hands. It is rumored that a single troll can easily best a group of half a dozen well armed and trained men, wasting each of them with a single blow. Not only men but horses too fear trolls. Be careful if you plan to charge one while mounted.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b|Do you think it comes from Mordor, or Isengard?
dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b:lord_mission_told|No, I don't think so. We have news that both the White Wizard and the Black Tower have all kinds of monsters among their ranks, but from what I hear the beast terrifying {s3} is one savage, untamed beast. Remember, there could be more than one. But you can be sure that some obscure craft from the Enemy has led this new plague upon us.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave servant like you, {playername}. The strangest rumors reach my ears from the forest of Fangorn. Minions sent to harvest wood, and even my commanders traversing the place, occasionally fail to return. Other times, they report of mysterious losses among their troops. They blame ghosts, spirits of the wood, ancient curses... Nonsense! Puny excuses for their own cowardice or ineptitude!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1|What do you command me to do about it, Master?
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|But Master, there is danger and pain in Fangorn! I've felt it myself!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2|Maybe it is just that my other servants are unable to prevent the most cowardly worms in their troops from deserting.  Fools, blinded by superstitions.   Or, maybe, it is the treacherous ambushes of elven scum, hiding in the putrid trees as they usually do.   It could even be lowborn traitors from Rohan.  Or who knows what else. I want you to find out, {playername}.
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted|I fear no elves or spirit. Leave this to me, Master.
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|Master, pity your servant! Don't ask me to venture in that cursed place!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected:lord_pretalk|So you are like the other worms: a superstitious, worthless coward.  I overestimated you. Now, begone!
dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good. Go there and shed some light on this matter. Then return to me and report. I expect to see you back with news before {reg1} dawns are passed.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_find_lost_spears|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave commander like you, {playername}. We are ill equipped to fight off the Rhun hordes. Our armies are losing battles one by one. A legend tells that once upon a time, there were spears made by Dwarves for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for..
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1|What do you command me to do about it, my lord?
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2|These weapons would increase the effectiveness of our armies, but above all they will lift the spirits of our men. You'll have to find these spears. You'll have to go ask the dwarves for permission to search for the spears in the deeps of the Lonely Mountain. Beware, you may encounter some orcs or trolls in the tunnels. Are you available for this task?
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_accepted|I fear no orcs nor trolls! I will find these spears for you, my lord.
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_rejected|I'm afraid I can't help you, my lord.
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_rejected:lord_pretalk|I see that discretion is the better part of your valor. Maybe you should stick to scouting duties.
dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good luck then!
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer|There is an important service you can deliver to our people, {playername}.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0|My power to defend and preserve Lothlorien has been diminished by the devices of the enemy. A master sorcerer of Dol Guldur is invoking powerful charms that inhibit our defenses. Though he is a mortal, he has become one of the enemies greatest pupils in the use of arcane rituals and he represents a great threat to our people. You must hunt him down and destroy him!
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1|Where can I find the sorcerer, my Lady?
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2|Search for him in Mirkwood forest, not far from Dol Guldur itself. He is both a well guarded and a cautious foe so you will need to use stealth to prevent the alarm from being raised. If he escapes, he will relocate to other dark places that we know not of and continue his wickedness unchallenged. There will be only one opportunity to defeat him. Much depends on your success. Go with our blessings.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_pretalk|As you command, my Lady. I will try my best to eliminate this evil.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected|Forgive me, my Lady. I have some pressing matters to attend before I can help your people with this endevour.
dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected:lord_pretalk|I understand, {playername}. But do not tally for too long, I'm growing tired of resisting his evil magic.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is an urgent matter... My messenger is due to report on our battle plans to commanders in {s14}. His trip has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time he must get through. So, I want to at least make sure he's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort him to {s14} and make sure he arrives safe and sound.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound,and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die. This man is dear to me, {playername},but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here.I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look,{reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation.Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request.

dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2:lord_mission_raise_troops_told|If you can raise {reg1} {s14} and bring them to me, that will probably be enough.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted|Of course, {s65}. Give me {reg1} fresh recruits and I'll train them to be {s14}.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected|I am too busy these days to train anyone.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You've taken a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command. Also, I'll advance you some money to help with expenses. Here, this purse should do it. Thank you for your help.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my bodyguards and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. There were news recently that the fugitive has been seen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and deliver him swift justice, and I'll reward you in turn.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}.  I will be grateful, and of course your prowess wil be duly noted.  Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|Well, some of the slaves working in {s4} have run away.  The ungrateful swine, whose lives we spared!  From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands now, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the one who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the enemy commanders and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to question him on the enemy battle plans. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I don't want to get close to any of them.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted:close_window|I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected:lord_pretalk|Clearly you lack the mettle I had thought you possessed. Very well, {playername}, I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion|I don't have a task for you right now, but your companion {s3} is a skilled {reg3?lass:fellow} and I need someone with {reg3?her:his} talents. Will you lend {reg3?her:him} to me for a while?

dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2:lord_mission_lend_companion_told|Just a few days, a week at most.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted|Then I will leave {s3} with you for one week.

dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's damned unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.3|Our scouts have noticed a recent increase in enemy activity. Unfortunately they almost never succeed in capturing live prisoners and bring them in for questioning, so we can piece together what the enemy is up to.

dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_choose_mode|I'm ready for training.
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]

We've not had a single attack reported for some time now.  If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for the safety of the place!  I think that concludes your task, {playername}. Thank you, and farewell.

dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. We cannot afford to lose the cargo you were carrying.
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, I'll see to find someone else. But tell me if you change your mind.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's attracted a few bands of tribal orcs to raid the surroundings during the confusion. I need somebody to teach those orcs a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid you have to find someone else for that.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the tribal orcs roaming around the countryside, probably looking to raid more farms. Kill the tribal orcs, and rid us of their presence. I'll pass a word to our supply chief, and you will get rewarded for every band of tribal orcs you destroy, until all the orcs are dealt with.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|Thanks for offering to help. Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine|I have a cargo of {s6} that needs to be delivered to the {s10} in {s4}. We need {reg5} units of {s6} to reach {s4} in {reg6} days. Can you do that?^^[you will earn {reg14} Resource Points of {s14}]
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will make the delivery.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|Thanks for offering to help.Actually I was looking for someone to supply us with Food.Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food|Our food supplies are dwindling and the supply trains are getting waylaid by the enemy.I need someone to bring us {reg5} units of food in {reg6} days, or we'll begin to starve.Maybe nearby friendly towns have enough for us too.

dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will find the food and bring it to you.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food:merchant_quest_stall|I am sorry, you'll need to find someone else for that.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|A task, you say? Actually I am looking for someone to supply us with ore and metals. Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}. With a pound of that iron, our smelter can make enough material to cover an entire pack of warriors.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron|We need {reg5} units of {s6} in {reg6} days, before our weaponsmiths run out of raw materials. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will get the metal scraps and bring them to you.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron:merchant_quest_stall|I am too busy to deal with that.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|Thanks for offering to help. Actually I was looking for someone to escort a supply train. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a supply train to {s8}. However with all those enemy patrols out there, I don't want to send them without an extra escort. A group at least {reg4} would offer them adequate protection.

dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_follow_lead|You follow my lead. I'll take you through a safe route.

dlga_merchant_caravan_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.6|Actually, I was looking for an able commander like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome goblins. They have infested the neighbourhood and are preying on supply trains and stray warriors. They have avoided all our patrols up to now.

They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these goblins alone and win. That seems to be the only way of getting rid of them. Are you up to the task?
