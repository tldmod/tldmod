After a continuous retreat from the East-gate and First Hall, then the Bridge of Khazad-dûm and Second Hall, the remaining Longbeards were forced all the way back into the Twenty-first Hall. After an unsuccessful attempt to escape through the Doors of Durin that saw the death of Óin, the Chamber of Mazarbul became the last hold-out of the Colony after losing the Twenty-first Hall just outside the chamber. Barring the gates, Ori and the few survivors set up a final defense.
