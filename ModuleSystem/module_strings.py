  ("tutorial_3_msg_1","This tutorial is intended to give you an overview of parrying and defence without a shield.\
 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\
 When you are defending with a weapon, you are only protected from one direction, the direction in which your weapon is set.\
 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\
 Either of these attacks would still be able to hit you.\
 That's why, in order to survive without a shield, you must learn directional defence.\
 Go pick up up the axe now to begin practice."),
  ("tutorial_3_msg_2","By default, the direction in which you defend (by clicking and holding your right mouse button) is determined by the attack direction of your closest opponent.\
 For example, if your opponent is readying a thrust attack, pressing and holding the right mouse button will parry thrust attacks, but not side or overhead attacks.\
 You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack.\
 If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether!\
 Now it's time for you to move on to the next room, where you'll have to defend yourself against an armed opponent.\

("tutorial_5_msg_1","Welcome to the fifth and final tutorial, which gives you a brief overview of how to command troops in battle, one of the most important aspects in Mount & Blade.^^\
The first command menu that you have to learn are movement commands, which can be found by pressing the F1 key. Press that now and explore the many movement options you can give your troops in battle.^^\
For this first step, command your troops to follow you and move up the hill where the flag and pointer is."),

("tutorial_5_msg_2","Excellent. Your troops have followed you up the hill. Now you have a good view of the battlefield.^^\
This time, ask your troops to hold this hill by pressing the F1 command menu again, and selecting Hold this Position (F1).^^\
Once you have done that, you will notice your troops stop following you and hold the position you asked them to.^^\
This is a good time to learn the second command menu, which revolves around troop basic formations.^^\
This menu allows you to command your troops to tighten up their ranks, to hold against infantry charges, or spread apart to resist archer volleys.^^\
Commanding your troops to move forward or backward ten paces using this command menu allows your troops to move while keeping their formation.^^\
After exploring the different options, keep your troops holding this hill and move alone towards the opposite hill, where the flag and the pointer is."),

("tutorial_5_msg_4","Now you have archers join your command. In Mount & Blade, you can give separate commands to specific divisions of troops such as infantry, archers, and cavalry.^^\
Pressing the number keys will choose the division of your choice (1 for Infantry, 2 for Archers, 3 for Cavalry). You can then use the command menus that appear to command the specific division.^^\
Note that the choice will persist, and pressing any of the command menus (F1, F2, F3) will be for the last division chosen. Read the messages that appear on your screen to see which division is being commanded.^^\
Now, ask your Infantry to follow you, then ask your Archers to follow you too. Once they are all together, go back to the hill you came from.^^\
Once there, look for the pointer and command your infantry to move and hold there by pressing 1, then holding the F1 key to reveal a banner. You can use this to move your troops in a precise location of your choice.^^\
Ask your archers to move towards the flag behind the pointer, and on high ground."),

("tutorial_5_msg_5","Your men are in position, the enemies have gathered and are charging towards you. Use what you learned to maneuver your infantry forward in formation, or ask them to charge. Charging breaks all formations, and moves your troops towards the nearest enemies.^^\
You can also keep your archers above ground for a better vantage point, or also ask them to move elsewhere.^^\
You can also press F3 to reveal the third command menu and learn about the different weapon orders you can give your troops."),

#backstory intro
  ("npc1_backstory_a", "You come at a difficult time, friend. Ithilien is flooded by enemy scouts and raiders, and some had seen great hosts of orcs on the move. We do try to prevent the foul creatures from crossing the great river and I have led a group of skilled Rangers to many a success. My Captain Faramir is bold and I don't despair of the Shadow hanging over us."),
  ("npc2_backstory_a", "Ah, how graceful to inquire about me. I have been newly assigned as a guard of His Stewardship's hallways, a proud duty, if I may say so, if not very eventful."),
  ("npc3_backstory_a", "Well, my old helmet here is getting smaller by the minute and the ground seems wobbly as if I rode a mischievous foil. Ah, if I only hadn't drank all that ale last night - I normally have a good head for drink, so it must have been some nasty orc brew."),
  ("npc4_backstory_a", "My name is Gálmynë, and I made it my business to know yours, {playername}. Let me explain why."),
  ("npc5_backstory_a", "You may have heard tales of my deeds in battles past and forgotten by mortal Men. In the fullness of time this War is yet another time of danger for the Eldar, but it will be the Last War."),
  ("npc6_backstory_a", "Excuse my brashness, stranger, but we don't have many visitors here and those that come do not look very trustworthy. Only a week ago, this dwarf appeared and... Never mind. My name is Luevanna, of the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood."),
  ("npc7_backstory_a", "Polite of you to ask, {playername}. We are fighting off incursions from Easterlings and Gundabad orcs, but so far nothing we and our Dale allies can't handle."),
  ("npc8_backstory_a", "I'm sure you can find some fine volunteers if you speak to the quartermaster in the barracks. As for me, I'm merely a healer and herbalist of modest skills."),
  ("npc9_backstory_a", "Good for you! They call me Gulm. I have gutted my sergeant and his snaga s now hunt for me.^The worthless piglet had it coming! Once, we got ambushed by a strawheads patrol... and he lost it. 'Fall back' he screams, then flees. Only Gulm and a few others stood firm, and broke their horses charge. Then we bludgeoned the yellow-haired into paste (heh heh heh). But if it wasn't for us strong ones, all would be worm food!"),
  ("npc10_backstory_a", "I am Durgash!"),
  ("npc11_backstory_a", "Nar! Not a tracker, that's who. They threw me out! I tell you they've lost their heads, that's what it is. Curse 'em! First they say I shoot wild, then I run too slow, and then I have a useless snuffler. Garn! If they don't find a rabble for me soon I'll be for the Black Pits, if what I hear is true. I'll make sure some of those Bosses lose their skins sooner than putting me in there!"),
  ("npc12_backstory_a", "I'm in command of a band of lads up here. I'm Gorbag and you'd best learn quick lubber us Uruks are the real bosses 'round here. The Big Bosses makes slips, 'ay, even the Biggest can make mistakes, and always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. They don't even tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. Grr!"),
  ("npc13_backstory_a", "I? I am a grain of soil from southern sands, blown north by cold and dark night winds. I am Lykyada, a Serpent Lord of Haradwaith. Lord of the Gold Serpent, bane of the Black Serpent Tribe, now allied to serve the will of the Dark Lord."),
  ("npc14_backstory_a", "I am Fuldimir, son of the southern realm of Umbar, south of Harondor, and the Bay of Belfalas, for both are home to my heart and my people. We are the lords of sea and sail, corsairs to some, kin of the Bay of Belfalas for her waters we tame."),
  ("npc15_backstory_a", "I am Bolzog the Gifted, Setter of Bones, Closer of Cuts, and Shaman of Healing. If you go to war for The Eye, you will no doubt have one or other of your little fellows cut about a bit by pale-faced foresters or the horse-lovers. Now, -nar-nar-nar! - Orcs are easy to replace, Oh Great Leader, but can you replace a Warg? A Giant? A Cave Troll? Shi-shi! No! You need me, the Great Bolzog!"),
  ("npc16_backstory_a", "Well now, it is the stranger who should declare himself first. Nevertheless, I am Varfang of the Balchoth kin... I can tell that you have not yet heard the songs or tales of my land that speak the name of the Balchoth, for the very name would check your courage and fill your heart with woe."),
  ("npc17_backstory_a", "They call me Dímborn and I work in the woods. It is nice there. I like the woods. Many trees in the woods. I like trees. I've worked in the woods all my life, because I am strong and because I like trees."),

#backstory main body
  ("npc1_backstory_b", "You should know that I am an Ithilien Ranger of Dúnedain descent and valor. I know much of tracking and scouting and my skill with bow and sword is known to the orc. I can also train any soul that's willing to fight the coming Shadow."),
  ("npc2_backstory_b", "I have been trained as a Minas Tirith watchman, to keep order in the White City and serve my lord Steward."),
  ("npc3_backstory_b", "I am a Rider of the Westfold éored - they left without me on a long patrol to the Isen fords. I know their conduct will be worthy of the green banner, but I fear many won't return."),
  ("npc4_backstory_b", "I was born into a noble family and I have been serving Lady Éowyn as a maid of honour ever since we were little girls. Our fathers were wise enough to allow us to train alongside our brothers in matters of combat, to become shieldmaidens of Rohan."),
  ("npc5_backstory_b", "Lord Elrond sent me as an emissary to Lord Celeborn, to give aid and advice as it's needed in the War in this part of Rhovanion."),
  ("npc6_backstory_b", "I like to walk the hidden paths in our beautiful forest. Sometimes I move quietly through the trees and observe the habits of the many woodland animals. The song of a rare bird, the nesting of a wild boar are as beautiful to me as the clash of weapons and great walls are to the Edain."),
  ("npc7_backstory_b", "I helped improve the Erebor defenses and trained some younger dwarven folk, under the direction of my venerated father Dwalin, as is our custom."),
  ("npc8_backstory_b", "I have treated my King Brand for constipation, a common malaise affecting men going to war. A light brew of wormwood, and both the bowels and the mind are put at ease."),
  ("npc9_backstory_b", "So I said to myself, 'Gulm, you want end up as carrion?' and I answered, 'No'.^Next battle, I fell back pretending I was injured. Then, with no one watching, I fell upon my sergeant! Cleaved him almost in half, gharr! Then cut his sidekick snaga nicely^^...Turned out that bloody creeper survived somehow, and started waggling his tongue about all this. Next time I make sure his head is off, gharr..."),
  ("npc10_backstory_b", "I am a Wolf Rider of Isengard and a tracker."),
  ("npc11_backstory_b", "Ar! It's only 'cause my nose was snotty. An' what good is it wearing my nose out on stones anyhow? Nar! It was those filthy Uruks! Those cursed peaching sneakthiefs! I only lost the scent through giving way to them. They messed up the scent back there, pinching anything they found, and stomping all round the place before I could get there."),
  ("npc12_backstory_b", "And those Nazgul give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving in the city. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em."),
  ("npc13_backstory_b", "I saw of late the word of the Dark Lord spread among my kin, and in their hearts and minds his will crept. Most were drawn to his darkness, and in place of their courage grew an insatiable lust for slaughter so that when their ears heard his call few puppets were so willing to answer."),
  ("npc14_backstory_b", "There is much change in a man who rides the tumult of the winds and seas of the Belfalas waters, and those yet to battle her will are but children. For stout men are they who meet her tempest and ride her storm. I have laid eyes on her darkest tide and yet remain her master."),
  ("npc15_backstory_b", "Many moons ago, when I was just a fresh little thing, my Grandsire led the tribe down into the mines, where the dwarves had recently died. A Fire Wraith had passed through, and it was comfortable and warm. We prospered, but every so often some cruel adventurer, or Dwarf hero, would come and kill and maim us in our peaceful tunnels. My hands learned to close the wound of sword or axe, and my mind learned to see the outline of bone and sinew below any hide. These days, I can work a potion or set a break with equal skill."),
  ("npc16_backstory_b", "The Balchoth were a fierce race of men from my home land, slaughtered by these westerlings to all but a few men. Chased down like beasts of burden as food for their blades. The blood spilt by those blades is the same blood that flows within me, for within me their house continues."),
  ("npc17_backstory_b", "You can make many things out of the trees, you know. It's what I do. I work with trees and make things out of trees. Sometimes bushes also. But I like trees more."),

#backstory recruit pitch
  ("npc1_backstory_c", "However, I fear we are hopelessly outnumbered here in Ithilien and we won't last long without reinforcements or bolder action by our Steward. I might as well help where my actions would account for more, if my Captain Faramir gives me leave."),
  ("npc2_backstory_c", "However important my duty here is, I'm quite anxious to see real combat and... elves and talking trees and oliphaunts! You seem well-travelled, commander, and I don't mean that as a slight on your appearance, not by a fathom. I learn quickly and can cook... well, good enough for soldiers that is. Am I not mistaken that you are looking for volunteers?"),
  ("npc3_backstory_c", "So, here I am, disgraced and bitter. My éored must be miles away now, and I wouldn't have a fair chance of catching up with them, not with all the orcs and wildmen roaming the plains. Are you by any chance in need of a fine Rohirrim rider?"),
  ("npc4_backstory_c", "You might know that women, however skilled, are not allowed to ride with the éoredas. However, I do not think that waiting by the hearth for the warriors to return is my fate. I will not sit idle until all chance of great deeds is gone in this War, and I would welcome your assistance, warrior."),
  ("npc5_backstory_c", "However, if the enemies of Lothlórien are on the run, I might consider joining you for a while, {playername}. I sense our fates in this War are interwoven."),
  ("npc6_backstory_c", "You wouldn't understand that, I think, seeing you prepared for war. But you must have travelled far and wide - have you seen the other great forests? Can you take me there?"),
  ("npc7_backstory_c", "There is a lull in the fighting that ill-suits a dwarven warrior of my ancestry and temperament. I gather you get to see much more action in your travels and your cause is friendly with the dwarves? I know a fighting dwarf will greatly improve your chances of survival."),
  ("npc8_backstory_c", "I hear there is much fighting elsewhere and our lands are gratefully spared for now. From the scratches on your armor you must have been in danger many times. Maybe my humble skills could be better used with your company, for the greater good of all."),
  ("npc9_backstory_c", "I am a fighting Uruk-hai, and a berserker! What there is to know of killing men, I know it. I was in the service of the White Hand, but now the Hand would as likely throw me into the fire-pits.^^I would come with you and hunt men in the south, while the snagas of Isengard gnash their teeth."),
  ("npc10_backstory_c", "Maybe you can be my next master."),
  ("npc11_backstory_c", "All right, all right! My nose isn't much use. I reckon my eyes are better than my nose. Ai! But my nose is only no good cause it don't know what nothing smells like. It don't even know what it's looking for, I tell you. Ar! I just need to go lopin' off and start sniffing places."),
  ("npc12_backstory_c", "Eh, if I get a chance, I'll slip off and set up somewhere on my own with a few trusty lads, somewhere there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em, like old times."),
  ("npc13_backstory_c", "I followed my kin north, and heeded his dark call, to fulfill the duty I have to my people. But in them I see his darkness dwell and I seek to do my part in this war elsewhere, until the sands of my time no longer fall. Even now I feel them begin to trickle where before there was a cascade."),
  ("npc14_backstory_c", "But there comes yet the darkest tide, a black tide of shadow, which will rise over these lands such as which no mortal eyes will have seen. This is the tide I seek to master, but I am without a crew hardy enough to ride this storm."),
  ("npc15_backstory_c", "After many winters I came up out of the tunnels, and looked about in the Dark Forests for a good place to live and practice my arts. I was doing fine, until some big ugly bastards with white tattoos – eugh! White! Like an elf face! – big bastards, they were. They fired my little place in the Forest, and I had to hide in the caves again... In here... Say, have you anything to eat? Maybe a nice horse?"),
  ("npc16_backstory_c", "That was many lives of men ago, a different time, but the time for grief and tales are over. The time for my people's retribution has come and I will carve my people's vengeance on the face of these western lands. By my hand, their homes will waste and wither until their clan is no more!"),
  ("npc17_backstory_c", "If you're going into the forest, maybe I come along and tell you about the trees there? Many very interesting trees there, you know."),


### use these if there is a short period of time between the last meeting 
  ("npc1_backstory_later", "I have been leading scouting parties to the south, as far as Emyn Arnen. There is much Enemy activity and many an orc fell to our ambush. Alas, that's only so many orc heads rolling down the gullies, we saw a myriad of foul creatures on the march. I fear for my Ithilien and the fate of Gondor."),
  ("npc2_backstory_later", "We've had a few visitors lately, and there are fewer to come. I reckon that doesn't bode well."),
  ("npc3_backstory_later", "Still no news of my éored, and I'm keen on riding down some orcs."),
  ("npc4_backstory_later", "More riders return with their bodies broken, and I try to give aid where I can. But I still feel trapped in a cage."),
  ("npc5_backstory_later", "Have you reconsidered? The time for the Eldar grows short."),
  ("npc6_backstory_later", "I've been observing a nest of giant spiders for a couple of days. Ugly creatures, they seem at first, but they keep intruders at bay. Did you come to ask me to travel with you?"),
  ("npc7_backstory_later", "Building up defensive walls is worthy of any dwarf. But I need to use my axe too. Soon. Let me come with you."),
  ("npc8_backstory_later", "I made another call to our King, this time for vomiting. I hope his resolve to engage the enemy is not related to his conditions. Do you suffer from constipation and vomiting too?"),
  ("npc9_backstory_later", "What do you think I do? Gulm is sitting here and waiting for some sneaky snaga to stick him in the dark. Take me with you - I will serve well."),
  ("npc10_backstory_later", "Have you reconsidered? I will serve well."),
  ("npc11_backstory_later", "Ar! It was you! I smelt you, I knew you were coming. Tell the Bosses that, will ya? They think since I was kicked out of the trackers that it's safe to flout me, well they're mistaken, I'll put an arrow in their guts first. And whose blames was that? Not mine!"),
  ("npc12_backstory_later", "I have my orders. Any trespasser found by my lads up here are to be stripped; teeth, nails, hair and all. But I've got my watchers. We know there are funny things going on: with the big bosses going off to war, and all that. Big things going on away west, they say. Sitting here doin' nothing is more than my belly's worth."),
  ("npc13_backstory_later", "My role here goes well for the dark cause, and once more the Northerners fear the south. I see great victories ahead, and rivers of blood left in our wake. But with each victory I see my kin corrupted, their hearts twisted to his evil will. The sight of it leads me to despair."),
  ("npc14_backstory_later", "You have returned stranger, it is perhaps an omen. I have been reading the waters, and I have seen them darken. The sea changes the eyes of a man, and teaches him to use his eyes to listen to her language."),
  ("npc15_backstory_later", "Many have been the great ones who have begged to be healed by my potions.   Horselovers and the pale-faced elves are many though, and I have had to abandon my hut once more, and am... well, Great Lord, I am not so lucky as when we fought together, and you were grateful for my skills..."),
  ("npc16_backstory_later", "Long does the history of my people recount these lands. I know not what their treacherous histories say of days when my people before entered this land, but sad and dark will their histories be as my people enter it now. Like a storm of hooves and swords and arrows, we will bring them doom like the Balchoth before us."),
  ("npc17_backstory_later", "I've seen a very old pine the other day. Pines can get very old. You have to respect old trees. But I've also seen some that don't respect trees at all. You respect trees, don't you?"),

  ("npc4_backstory_response_1", "I would welcome the help of a Rohan shieldmaiden, if offered."),

#general idea=Enthusiastic about their horseplay and way of life, angry with Saruman.
("rohan_rumor_begin", "It breaks my heart to see my babies off to war! But without them the men would have to walk."),
("rohan_rumor_2", "I hear orcs eat horses. Foul beasts! They also eat prisoners. That is bad too, of course."),
("rohan_rumor_3", "There are no horses finer than Rohan's. Even the Elves get their horses from us!"),
("rohan_rumor_4", "If you can heal men, please treat my horses with just as much care should they be wounded."),
("rohan_rumor_5", "Bring me eight Sumpter Horses, he says... after the seven he asked for yesterday.  Makes you wonder."),
("rohan_rumor_6", "Gondor prefers sturdier horses. Our riders enjoy speed. The Elves get only the best. And our enemies steal them!"),
("rohan_rumor_7", "I've seen breeds of the desert mare and Variag horse. Rohan horses are clearly superiour but require a more experienced rider to handle."),
("rohan_rumor_8", "Wargs are slower than horses but can turn faster. They are also quite fragile compared to a well-bred warhorse."),
("rohan_rumor_9", "Armies march on Rohan with pikes and spears set against our fine horsemen. The traitor Saruman will cut down the whole Fangorn forest equipping his armies before this war is over."),
("rohan_rumor_10", "Being the best horsemen in the realm starts with raising the best horses."),
("rohan_rumor_11", "Most of the horses you see in Gondor came from us. They prefer a slightly stronger, slower horse that can carry their heavy armour."),
("rohan_rumor_12", "We say in Rohan that a horse is like a man. That if a horse is good it is like a man is good, and that if a horse is bad, is like a man is bad. And if a horse is hungry is like a man is hungry, and if a horse is sad is like if a man is sad. And we say if a horse is happy is like when a man is happy. We say if a horse is angry is like if man is angry. We say if a horse walk is like when a man walk, we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old, and we say if horse is young is like when a man is young. And the same we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old. And if a horse small, is like when a man's small."), #maybe we could do the whole endless Borat thing here, with player only being able to say "Yes" until the guy is finished. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_KH28KuZ3I

("rohan_rumor_16", "Gondor practices archery. We practice horse archery. Dunlendings practice neither."),
("rohan_rumor_17", "Many of Saruman's orcs are deadly archers. Many are not. A wise cavalry commander shouldn't wait to discover which is which."),

("gondor_rumor_15", "The Southerners are pushing us out of Harondor. They've been raiding us hard for some time. I wish I could walk safely through the green fields of Lebennin again. But we are told 'No.', our soldiers are to protect the heart of the realm."),

("gondor_intro", "^It is a bitter thought, that a hero of this great kingdom should die within the sight of his land, unaided and helpless.^^\
The news of Boromir’s death passed like a swift wind through all of Gondor, even to the plains of Pinnath Gelin and the hills of Lamedon, even to the shores of Pelargir and the coasts of Dol Amroth. The hearts of all your people are filled with grief and pity; and more besides, with fear and foreboding, for Gondor is hard pressed and sore beset, ringed by implacable foes or uncertain friends.^^\
The Shadow rises in the East, as of old; the fractious Corsairs of Umbar grow bolder; the wild men of the East and South press their claims upon Gondorian land.^^\
No longer can you stand by and wait. Trust you have placed in your captains; sword and spear they will place in your hand. Gondor wanes, but Gondor still stands; and even the end of its strength is still very strong. You have resolved yourself to play what part you may in this coming war against the servants of the Nameless. Much is spoken of in the councils of the great and wise, to which you are not privy, but there is one thing you feel you can be sure of.^^\
If the valiant hearts of Gondor should fail, and Minas Tirith be lost, then the last light of the West will be extinguished. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

("dwarf_intro", "^The Kingdom under the Mountain has done well, of that there can be no dispute. Old King Dáin has just passed his two hundred and fiftieth year, and by any measure he is fabulously wealthy. Under his rule, Erebor thrives, and knows greatness. The waterways, fountains and pools of neighbouring Dale bear witness to how your builders have surpassed the skill of even your forefathers, though their secrets of metalwork have regrettably been lost.^^\
Yet a darkness from Mordor entered these halls, when Sauron’s foul envoy, with his breath like the hiss of snakes, came bearing evil words. Heavy have been the hearts of your chieftains since then, for the power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed. The Shadow grows and draws nearer - already the Enemy is moving, and war will soon begin.^^\
You have sworn to take up arms, and stand with your friends against your foes. You will resist, with hope or without it.^^\
But if the bravery of the Dwarves of Erebor should prove insufficient, then the glory of Durin’s folk will fade away and be forgotten. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

("rohan_intro", "^In these days of doubt, one thing you know to be true: open war lies before the proud people of Rohan. None may live now as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. Some close to the King’s ear speak craven counsels, but you have determined to go to him, take a grim oath of service, and stand with such fell-handed captains and thanes as will protect the herds and herdfolk.^^\
Saruman of Isengard has declared lordship over the lands of Rohan, and bitter is the fighting with Orcs, Wolf-riders and the evil Men of Dunland. The Lord of the Black Land to the east sends raiding parties to steal your horses, choosing always the black ones. Your heart misgives you, for it seems to you that enemies beset your people both east and west.^^\
But still you will give battle, for if aught is said of the Rohirrim, it is of your unfailing valour in arms, though foe should beleaguer you, or fire encircle you. The steeds of Rohan will stride as wind in the morning. And if death should come for you, then a mound will be raised, but for now, war calls you. Let horse be bridled, horn be sounded!^^\
Yet, if even the courage of the Sons and Daughters of Eorl should fail, then the last hope of Rohan will fade and die away. The horn will blow no more. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

("mordor_intro", "^The dark power rises again in the East. The numbers of the Dark Lord’s legions swell - Easterling men come to serve and pay tribute, hollow-eyed renegades from ancient Numenor craving a chance to regain what their ancestors lost, great hosts of orcs and uruks slavering at the thought of war and killing. The pens are filled with ferocious, fearsome wargs. And high above, in the black skies, fly the winged Nazgûl… the apple of the Great Eye, with power deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams.^^\
You have resolved to rise in the ranks, by any means, and gain the favour of Lugbúrz. By wit, hardiness, and ruthless skill in battle you shall crush all who stand in your way. You will earn the favour of the Dark Lord of Mordor, he who is to rule all after this coming War… or you will die trying.^^\
The light of the West shall be snuffed out. The time of Mordor has come!"),

("isengard_intro","^A new power is rising, and you are part of that power. You march and fight under the banner of the White Hand, and your allegiance is sworn to crafty old Saruman the Great, wise and cunning, who gives you the tasty flesh of man and horse to eat.^^\
Under his banner march the fighting Uruk-hai. They are slayers of great warriors, winners of battles. Their armour is thick and their shields broad. You will make a name for yourself among your fellows, and hew down many Whiteskins. You will not stop, by sun or moon, by fair weather or storm, until your enemies lie dead and broken.^^\
The skill of Saruman is great. With it, you will throw down the power of the horse people, and their weak allies; yes, even elf-flesh will be yours to feast upon. Their villages and forests will burn, and their cities too. And then… who is to say if the maggots and apes of Lugbúrz will not defer to the mighty ones of Orthanc, eh? The strong command. The weak will serve.^^\
The Age of Man is ending. The time of Isengard has come!"),

("lorien_intro", "^It is the custom of your people, the Galadhrim of Laurelindórenan, to dwell in the treetops. The great trees of mighty girth bear leaves of gold and blossoms of yellow, and by the waters of the Nimrodel one may find restful sleep and forgetfulness of grief; but in these darkening days none may long forget the Shadow that hovers near, pressing in from the east, from the dark land of Mordor and nearer still.^^\
For many a long year, your kin of Lothlórien have had few dealings with other folk. Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides those who still oppose him. Yet you are one of those who can perceive that to keep living thus, an island amid many perils, will bring only despair. Some there are among you who sing that the Shadow will draw back, and peace shall come again; and though the world can never be as it was of old, yet will you take up sword and bow, and play your part in the War to come, to defend not only the Dreamflower that you love, but perhaps lands beyond, that will otherwise fall to evil.^^\
For if the old friendships are not renewed, and thought is taken only to fight the long defeat, then shall the last light of Lórien go out forevermore. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

("imladris_intro", "^Alas, for these latter days of grieving memory! In Imladris, the homely house of Elrond Halfelven, one may recall somewhat of the glory and splendour of Eregion in the Elder Days. But the world will never again be as it was of old.^^\
The fields of Eriador, though lovely to behold, are tilled no more by the hands of Men. The Dúnedain, much diminished in number after the breaking of Arnor, keep their lonely vigils in the desolate wilderness of the North. And the days of Gil-Galad are forever gone, for the Firstborn decrease, and go into the west, while the blood of ancient Númenor dwindles and the race of Westernesse decays.^^\
Though Rivendell remains a place of sanctuary, the days darken in all the lands around.^^\
A last rallying call has gone forth, and a great host from Imladris - perhaps the last such in all the Ages of the world - shall march. You are part of this host, and though you will do your duty as instructed by the wise and the great, your heart is not without misgivings. Neither in Imladris, nor in the Grey Havens, nor even in Lórien the Golden Wood, is there strength to withstand the full might of the Enemy, should it come assailing when all else is overthrown.^^\
Yet a slim hope remains: if the old friendships can be renewed, and all who stand against evil join strength against the common foe, some time may yet be won, so that the final end of the menace of Mordor may yet be sought.^^\

("woodelf_intro", "^A shadow lies over the Woodland Realm, a poison spreading through the air itself from Dol Guldur. The Lord of Mordor has returned to his dark tower, and his lieutenants in Dol Guldur have turned much of Greenwood the Great, Eryn Galen, into places of great fear, where even your people, the Silvan Elves of the north, will not freely go.^^\
Thranduil son of Oropher leads your people, but has been cautious in his policy - fresh is the grief of Dagorlad, perhaps, to his memory. Yet, now that the men of Dale are threatened by the coming war, your king has roused himself. Ever does he look to the south with a deep shadow in his heart, and long will he tarry ere he leads his people into likely ruin, but the day of decision is upon him.^^\
With spear and blade and bow, you will defend the borders of your realm at your king’s command - and if need be, you are resolved to aid any who would stand against the common foe alongside the Elves of Mirkwood.^^\
For fear speaks in your heart, as it does for many of your fellows, that if the old friendships are not renewed, and old allies come to ruin, then Mirkwood shall be darkened forever. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

("dale_intro", "^For three generations of men, the Kingdom of Dale has prospered. King Brand, grandson of Bard the Bowman, rules justly, and trade has enriched the realm.^^\
But enemies now encroach, gathering across the border to the east - fractious, quarrelsome nomads, with whom speech is difficult and trust harder still. Toys and bells and pretty dolls must now be set aside, for spear and bow and sturdy shield. Trees must be hewn not for the walls of a new steading, but for quivers and the arrows to fill them with. Young men go not to till the fields or harvest the orchards, but to the barracks, to war and a red dawn.^^\
Yet Dale has stalwart allies: the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain, whose masonry decorates every street of Dale. And, too, the Elves of Mirkwood have had traffic with your people, to the good of all. The stout Beornings of the Ford keep the trade routes safe and open. In these dark days, all who reject the overlordship of Mordor must stand together, or be singly cut down like wheat stalks in the field.^^\
You have resolved to do your part, for if the steadfast defenders of Dale should fail, then the line of Bard will be ended, and the last kingdom of Men in the north will be no more. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

("harad_intro", "^From the deep deserts, the thick jungles and the sun-soaked riverlands, we have come. Let the people of Gondor stand in awe of us, and make submission.^^\
They have said that the lands south of the river Poros are theirs by ancient right, and they therefore call it Harondor, “South Gondor”, and call us invaders. This their claim, we have not understood. Was it not in the time of the Plague that the Great Serpent made his will known in driving the Gondorians out by death and illness, and allowed our forefathers to settle there and grow in numbers? How could any men, without the blessings of the Powers and merely from their own strength, claim this land? Did our ancestors not live here, when theirs died or left?^^\
Furthermore, they have said that in times long past they first gave us crafts and the skill of growing food upon the land; therefore we should become as vassals unto them. This, too, we have not understood, for well our learned men remember the days of their king Tar-Ciryatan and those after him who took from our people much tribute, and plundered for themselves the richest treasures of our lands. And when they behave arrogantly, saying, “Be grateful, and pay tribute to the Steward of Gondor,” having no king for many long years by reason of immense foolishness, how do they dare to press their claims upon us?^^\
We like not the company of foul orcs, and the Dark Sorcerer demands great sacrifice. Many young men and women we have given up to him, in the Dark Land, and still he wants more. Yet, with his power and aid, all the lands from the rising of the sun to its setting shall come to us, and we shall own them.^^\

They say many things, but you know you do not fight for a life of ease, like the fat and weak Lake-people, or the short greedy diggers scurrying around in their tunnels of stone, or the cowardly elves skulking in the trees singing songs.^\
All that matters is glory, won in battle, and it is not the promises of chieftains that will win you a place of honour on the great Mountain after you die; it is by skill and strength that you will win the right to stand there. If you must fight alongside filthy honourless Orcs for a time, so be it - but your deeds will be your own, and they will be told over and over, around the campfires, for many generations to come.^^\

Boys and girls alike must survive the fighting pits for many moons, before they may take their place among grown men and women. Such ways have made your people strong. Little wonder, then, that the Lord of the Black Land speaks so fairly to your Shibh! He knows a single sharp halberd in the hands of a Variag of Khand is worth twenty spears in the hands of worthless orcs.^^\
Many promises have been made to your leaders. A great host has been assembled, the greatest yet in living memory. From the farthest reaches of your lands, the fiercest fighters among your people have answered the summons. You will plunder the lands of the weak, decadent Gondorians. You will take many of them as slaves, and make them work their rich green lands for you, as is the right of the conqueror.^^\

His descendants have led your nation well, winning many great victories on the seas and the coasts.^^\
Time and again, however, the bitter winds of defeat have blown in your face - some years ago, the faithless Gondorians launched a cowardly night attack upon the main haven, sending the better part of Umbar’s strength down to the sea floor. Your ship was lost, your captain with it, and you were among the few survivors of your erstwhile crew.^^\
But fifty great ships remain, and countless smaller vessels besides. The Dark Lord of Mordor has issued the call. Now is the time for a reckoning. You will join hands with your brothers-in-arms of the Southern lands, the grim-eyed men of Harad, and you will exact your vengeance upon the treacherous men of Gondor, until all Belfalas and Anfalas is in flames, and your coffers overflow with the wealth that is rightfully yours.^^\

Your tribe was strong, and rich - the Moria-silver you gathered, in great heaps, and with it won great favour from the Dark Lord in the East. The short ones came, thinking to make their homes here - but you slaughtered them and had great sport in the doing. Then a small band of thieves and brigands came through, and awoke the deep Fire. Ruin, ruin for all! Many places cannot now be reached. Much wealth, much Moria-silver, and all too deep to dig up!^^\
But now the Dark Lord calls. War comes. The Great Eye will reward faithful servants, yes. He will remember who it was who sent him so much of this shiny Moria-silver, and you will obey him - you will kill, and feast upon the Whiteskins, and all will be well for you and your tribe. And those proud elves, in their golden forest, they won’t be so proud when you and your folk burn their trees down around them!^^\

The forges overflow with weapons and armour, the pens house thousands of ferocious wargs, the barracks are full to the brim with orcs ready to fight and die.^^\
And high above, in the darkening skies over Mirkwood, fly the winged Nazgûl… the apple of the Great Eye, with power deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams. No fewer than three has the Dark Lord sent to this place, from which his power will reach, subduing all who resist, until the enemies of Mordor are broken forever.^^\
You have resolved to rise in the ranks, by any means, and gain the favour of Dol Guldur and Lugbúrz. By wit, hardiness, and ruthless skill in battle you shall crush all who stand in your way. You will earn the favour of the Dark Lord, he who is to rule all after this coming War… or you will die trying.^^\
The shadow of Dol Guldur shall spread. The light of the West shall be snuffed out. The time of Mordor has come!"),

From the time of mighty Freca, felled by a cowardly blow from the man-eater beast Helm, he whom the Rohirrim called Hammerhand, you have suffered grievously under their heavy yoke. High-handed are their treacheries, too many to number.^^\
 But now the wind is changing. Wise Saruman, the cunning old master of Isengard, has made promises of friendship to your people. With his help, surely the claim of noble King Wulf, who in happier days rightfully sat the throne of Meduseld in Edoras, will be upheld.^^\
No longer will your people scrabble in the rocky soil for a hard living. No longer will babes in arms die in the embrace of their mothers, because the milk flows too weakly. No longer will your people cower in fear of the murdering usurpers of Rohan. Your pikes are long, and your axes cruel and sharp. With the help of Saruman the Wise, you cannot fail. You will take back what is rightfully yours.^^\
You will fight for Saruman. You will die for Saruman!"),

("beorn_intro", "^These woods, these old paths, and the Ford are the only home you have ever known, but old Beorn was one who remembered an older home, far away in the mountains. His son, Chief Grimbeorn the Old, now stands foremost among your people, and like his father, he is apt to sit on the great Carrock at night, setting his sight to the west, deep in his own thoughts.^^\
For your part, your thoughts are simple. The woods grow dangerous. Foul orcs grow bolder, and walk about even in daylight. The wolves they ride will not listen even to one of your people, so twisted have they become by goblin ways. The air feels and smells different, bad. The further south you go, closer to Dol Guldur, where not so long ago the Sorcerer dwelled and did things unworthy of naming, the worse it gets.^^\
The Elves huddle in their caves to the north. Most will not come out to protect the woodland, its animals and trees and other things that move and live.^^\
Your people will fight, as you always have, to keep the Ford and the forest safe. With a stout stick in your hands, you will smash any orcs that dare intrude. And if it should come to greater blows, why, many among your people are more than they seem…^^\
But if even the grim battle-strength of the Beornings should fail, then the world will know no more the joy of sweet honey, bright flowers, shady forest paths and all things good. All will fall beneath the Shadow."),

Armies of Mordor consist of orcs, Uruks and evil men (Black Númenoreans). Uruks of Mordor are a better-equipped and stronger breed of orcs, but have no archery line. Most regular orcs are infantry, skirmishers or archers, but there are also orc warg-riders. Black Númenoreans are comparatively rare, but very dangerous as infantry or cavalry.

The forces of Isengard are quite well-equipped, though the weapons and armour may seem crude.

Their forces consist of an infantry line and a scout line, with the occasional incorporation of an elite unit of Noldorin horse archers. All their troops are highly skilled, equipped with the finest arms and armour of Elven make, and overall extremely deadly in combat.

Their horses are thin and weak, certainly no match for the steeds of Rohan, though occasionally the Dunlendings will ride them into battle as skirmishers.

Three!"),
("npc19_backstory_a" , "A small drop, to be sure, but my dam has told me all about my lineage. I am Heidrek, direct descendant of King Fengel, closer to the throne of Rohan and Dunland than any of our chieftains! Dark is my hair, but I fancy I have more than a strand of yellow in there somewhere."),
("npc20_backstory_a" , "In my dream, there was a tree. A tree, all of white. And you, you were there, standing beside it.

Once, we got ambushed by a strawheads patrol... and he lost it. 'Fall back' he screams, then flees. Only Gulm and a few others stood firm, and broke their horses charge.

("npc19_backstory_b" , "Well, you will not find any of Rohan or Dunland who will accept my claim, but it is a true one nonetheless. My grand-dam was a herdswoman, living in the hills, and one day it chanced that old King Fengel, the greedy grasping grandfather of Theoden the Pretender, happened to see her on the banks of the Isen. He took a fancy to her, and my dam was his child."),

Only a few generations ago, it was at the very doors of Meduseld that the last son of Helm Hammerhand was slain, and thereafter Wulf was King, for a time.

("gondor_guildmaster_companion_none", "Nay, Commander. What valour we have is needed to defend our own walls. You may go to the barracks and find soldiers of courage and experience - mayhap more the former than the latter, I fear. Ever have we been traders, crafters and farmers. The finest of our soldiers go to the capital to enlist - perhaps you should try the White City."),
("gondor_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "Very well. I thank you for your counsel."),
("gondor_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "I thank you. May the good will of all good people go with you."),

("gondor_mt_guildmaster_companion", "Why, Commander, there is one, and gladly shall I tell you of him; he is a gate guard, by the name of Cirdil, and even now I warrant you’ll find him at his rounds. He is dutiful and brave - but I spoke with him of late, and it seems to me he wishes to do more than simply stand his watch on the walls while the Shadow gathers beyond them. Surely he will be happy to venture out from the White City in your company."),
("gondor_ha_guildmaster_companion", " Indeed there are. High in the esteem of our Captain Faramir are two of our commanders, Mablung and Damrod. Damrod is away at our Captain’s behest; but Mablung may be found in the cave yonder, a little way along this path here. We Rangers know much of woodlore and archery; Mablung stands above many of us. He is a man of prowess, and accounted one of our finest. Mayhap he will be given leave to accompany you for a time."),

("rohan_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "By leave of Theoden King, I seek the aid of valiant Rohirrim. Will any stout warriors here follow me?"),
("rohan_guildmaster_companion_none", "It were better if you sought to bring aid, rather than asked for it. Horses, swords, spears - these things we need at present. As for your question: go to the barracks. There you will find those of our people willing to ride forth, such as they are - many beardless youths still, and still others unskilled herders and tenders of flocks."),
("rohan_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "I do take thought for your people as well, Thain. Farewell."),
("rohan_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "That counsel seems good to me. Health be with thee at thy coming and going!"),

("rohan_edoras_guildmaster_companion", "Indeed, there may be. Dark indeed must the days become before our women ride out to war alongside the menfolk - yet our fearless and high-hearted Lady Eowyn, whom all love, rides and fights as well as any Marshal. Some shieldmaidens have trained with her from childhood, and several may be found around the Golden Hall. Hardy indeed are our women! Seek one called Galmyne - she is skilled in many arts of war, and goes about like a mare chafing at an ill-fitting bridle, for she has not been given leave to ride out with the men."),

("lorien_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "Elder, I seek aid. The least among the Elves of Lorien fight like heroes of old; will any here join my cause?"),
("lorien_guildmaster_companion_none", "Evil has been seen and heard even here, among the mallorn-trees; sorrow has been known. In happier days we plucked the strings of harps; in these days we have indeed become skilled at the plucking of bowstrings. I cannot speak of heroes among us, but you should speak to the commander of our garrison here. Perhaps some few of our people may consent to join you for a time."),
("lorien_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "I had hoped for fairer words in this fair land of yours. But it shall be as you say, Elder."),
("lorien_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "I thank you for your counsel, Elder. Tiro ven Elbereth!"),

("lorien_ca_guildmaster_companion", "Nan Belain, here is a wonder indeed! At any other time I might have had naught but disappointment for you, but now in the company of the Lord and Lady of the Wood stands none other than the Lord Glorfindel, hero of more battles than even I can remember. I know little of such a great champion’s purpose here - he arrived with the host of Elrond, Lord of Imladris, and his own counsel he keeps, speaking only with Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel. Seek him out, Commander. Perhaps his cause may be joined to yours."),

("beorn_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "Your advice, good fellow - are there any warriors of remarkable prowess here?"),
("beorn_guildmaster_companion_none", "Well, I don’t know about that. Your question isn’t very clear. What kind of “remarkable prowess” do you want that you can’t find among our garrison, I ask you? We fight with stout staves and sharp hatchets, we shoot well enough with bows. I don’t know what more you could ask for."),
("beorn_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "Well, then, I suppose I’d best be off. Good day to you, woodsman."),
("beorn_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "I see. Well, I shall look around for this “Dimborn”. Good day to you, woodsman."),

("beorn_house_guildmaster_companion", "Well, now, there’s a question. I’d say any of us could fight off a goblin or warg well enough, but our chief’s nephew is stouter than most. Spends most of his time just staring at trees, though. Or at nothing in particular. More thew than thought, if you take my meaning. Still, he’s gentle with his friends but fierce to his enemies, as one should be. Walks the woods as well as any Elf, I’d say. We call him Dimborn; not to be unkind, you understand, but we like calling things and people what they are. He ought to be around here somewhere."),

("woodelf_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "By leave of Thranduil Elvenking, I seek champions of the Greenwood to fight in my command, Elder."),
("woodelf_guildmaster_companion_none", "Indeed? Then you may ask those of our garrison, and mayhap some will be willing to follow you. But I sense your desire runs deeper than that. Do you fancy yourself a great hero, like those from Nargothrond or Gondolin of old? Our finest warriors are needed to guard against the growing shadow in Mirkwood. Take with you what soldiers we can spare, and be content."),
("woodelf_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "Very well, Elder. As you say."),
("woodelf_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "I thank you for your counsel, Elder. Navaer!"),

("woodelf_halls_guildmaster_companion", "Indeed? There is one among us whose aid you should not despise. Luevanna is her name, and she is kin to me, as it happens. She is young, as our people reckon it, and has an abiding love for the woods and all the creatures in it, save those which are evil. Hers is a gentle spirit - she has not fought in our array. Still, I have a hope that she may be persuaded to follow you, for then she may come to learn that though we love peaceful ways in peaceful days, times of war call for warlike deeds. See, there she stands - you may speak with her. Harthon gerithach lend vaer!"),

("dale_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "Good master, I seek stout warriors of prowess to fight beside me in this war."),
("dale_guildmaster_companion_none", "Well, now. Here in our town, we have always plied our trades and managed our affairs quietly, and not until recently have we had a great need for fighting men. I suppose you might ask at our barracks, and find what recruits you can from our garrison. I know of none among our captains here who would abandon his post to follow you."),
("dale_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "I will do that, good master. Farewell to you."),
("dale_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "Oft the unbidden gift proves the best value. I will speak to Faniul. Farewell!"),

("dale_main_guildmaster_companion", "Well, the King and his Lords have the best claim on the service of good captains. I don’t know that any of great renown are left to follow you - but are mere fighting men all you need? What about binders of wounds, versed in herblore? I know of one such - Faniul, personal healer to the King. She was midwife to my sister - and do not look askance at her age: she is of stout heart and sturdier than she looks. I warrant she’ll bear up well under the strains of travel. Why, I think I see her taking her ease over there, in this courtyard."),

("dwarf_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "Good master, there seem to be some valiant warriors here. Will any follow my company?"),
("dwarf_guildmaster_companion_none", "Well, you’re not wrong, there, about our skill in battle, but aren’t our lads from our garrison here good enough for you? Apart from them, I don’t know anyone else who might satisfy you - you talk as though you were a king of some sort, looking for a great champion, like in the old days. Valiant is as valiant does, say I!"),
("dwarf_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "You needn’t get so annoyed, good master, I was simply asking. Good day to you."),
("dwarf_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "That is excellent to hear, good master. Good day to you!"),

("dwarf_erebor_guildmaster_companion", "Oh ho! It’s warriors you’re after, are you? Then I have just the Dwarf for you: look for one Kili Goldfinger. A most excellent and audacious Dwarf he is, and a credit to his clan. Fights almost as well as a Longbeard, though he’s still fairly young as we reckon it. Quite good at story-telling, too, and he favours the cheerful sort of tale. Go and have a talk with him - I shouldn’t think he needs much persuading to follow you out into the wide world and do his bit for the war. Now, let me see… he’s not down here at the moment. Not the Great Chamber, either. The upper halls, perhaps - look for him there."),

("rhun_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "I heard there were great warriors here. Where are they? Who are worthy to join me?"),
("rhun_guildmaster_companion_none", "Not all our warriors here are blooded, but each of them is stronger and braver than any ten Dalishmen! Go and ask the arms master to see if he can spare any for you."),
("rhun_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "I ask for great warriors, and you show me drinkers of mother’s milk. Pah!"),
("rhun_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "That is good to hear. Finally - a warrior with spirit!"),

("rhun_maincamp_guildmaster_companion", "Our greatest swordbearers and riders fight in the retinues of our warlords. But there is one who has found favour with none of our chiefs so far. Not because he is weak; far from it! He does not curb his tongue when he speaks, and he has spoken loudly against our chieftains, saying they are slow to act and over-cautious. If he had his way, I wager the countryside would be covered in flames by now. His name is Varfang, and he spends his hours training near the prisoner cages, not far from this tent."),


("guldur_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "All I see here is a rabble of treacherous skulkers, more likely to run than fight. Where are your proper warriors?"),
("guldur_guildmaster_companion_none", "O ho! What do we have here? A great captain, are you? I reckon your bark’s worse than your bite, and no mistake. Orders are orders: you draw your troops from our garrison here, and that’s that. Keep talking like that where they’ve got ears to hear, though, and someone will stick a knife in your back one of these days, see if they don’t."),
("guldur_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "You’ll watch your words with me, if you know what’s good for you."),
("guldur_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "Scared witless by this woman, are you? I’ll go see if she’s all you make her out to be. This had better not be a waste of my time!"),

("guldur_main_guildmaster_companion", "We’ve got stout lads aplenty, curse you. Ha… I know what you’re really after. Oh yes, indeed, I know just where you should go, Commander. See that cave over there, with steps leading down? If our boys get hurt badly enough we send them down there, and I reckon almost a third of them make it back up, har! They can do very strange things, down there… and that one in particular, the woman… she gives me the shivers, and that’s saying something. They say she’s got something to do with Number One, or even Higher Up, if you take my meaning. Talk to her, if you dare."),

("moria_guildmaster_companion_none", "Proper warriors, {she/he} says! I reckon any of our snaga could give any of your lubbers a good drubbing. We’re a tough lot, we are, and no mistake. Go speak to our barracks master - but speak with respect, mind, or you’ll not get our stout fellows to follow you. Knife you as soon as your back is turned, if you don’t speak proper."),
("moria_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "I’ll speak how I like to the lot of you. I save my respect for those much Higher Up than your sort!"),

("moria_main_guildmaster_companion", "Ha! Losing more than you can keep, are you? Throwing our stout lads into the meat grinder, and then cursing when you find you haven’t got enough left to win your battles? A right splendid commander you are, oh yes. Very well - look over there! I’ll give you a helpful hint now, and you’ll remember it, yes? You see that fellow on the crates, the one with blood all over his hands, muttering to himself? Not much of a killer, but where’s the blood from, I hear you ask? Why, it’s the blood from some of our fighters he’s helped put back on their feet. He’s a sawbones, that one. You’ll see for yourself, the next time you lead your troops into another mess and find you need some stitching done."),

("isengard_guildmaster_companion_none", "Leading patrols and armies of their own, no doubt - why would they lower themselves to fight under your command? They’ve got their own Orders to follow, from Higher Up. If you want fighting lads, go talk to the garrison chief! We’ve got stout fellows aplenty."),

("isengard_main_guildmaster_companion", "A great commander you are, it is plain to see, and wisely do you choose to take only the bravest and most skilled fighters under your banner. And yet, if you will take my counsel - a battle is won not merely with iron and sinew, Commander, but with guile and foreknowledge of the foeman’s doings, his comings and goings. We have a scoutmaster here, an Orc who has sworn allegiance to Saruman the Great. I have heard that he spent many years in the Misty Mountains, catching and taming wargs. A skilled tracker and hunter is Durgash. You will find him a most useful helper, Commander. He's usually lurking around the warg pits."),
("isengard_hunting_camp_guildmaster_companion", "O ho! So you think our finest lads should humble themselves and take orders from you, do you? You’re a bold one, and no mistake. I know just the fellow for you. Calls himself Gulm, and he’s a proper fierce one, he is. Never seen anyone take so much pleasure in bashing in skulls and breaking bones with that mallet of his. And the more foes he kills, the more savage he seems to get. I don’t rightly know where he is at the moment, though - but he’s in this camp for sure, trying not to attract attention for some reason. Does that sound suitable for you, O Great Commander, taking an Uruk-hai berserker into your camp?"),

("dunland_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "So, these are the Men of the hills who serve the White Hand! A sorry-looking lot. Where are your fighters of note?"),
("dunland_guildmaster_companion_none", "Following those greater than you, no doubt. If you want warriors, speak to the training masters. See for yourself if any of our young pups will follow you into battle."),
("dunland_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "Curs and whelps! It is no wonder your people were driven into the hills by the men of Rohan."),
("dunland_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "A treacherous wolf, I would hardly keep by my side. But a tame hunting dog, I might consider. Let me see which one this Heidrek proves to be."),

("dunland_main_guildmaster_companion", "Despise us at your peril! Even a wretched cur will snap at your heels in a fight. We will have our vengeance on the Forgoil and their allies - and likely it will be Heidrek whom we’ll follow into Edoras. He’s a mongrel, that one - says he’s the grandson of a strawhead king, for all that he looks no different from any of us. He’s a terror in the training yard. If Chief Daeglaf doesn’t watch his back he just might find Heidrek’s spear in it one of these days. Maybe he’ll deign to follow you, if he thinks you’re worth his time. Look for him at the main campfire, where our chieftains stand."),

("khand_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "She sounds like a killer, right enough - but can her ferocity be leashed to useful purpose? We shall have to see."),

("khand_main_guildmaster_companion", "So you want great warriors? We have them aplenty. But let me tell you of one whose savagery even we find astonishing. Her name is Turmbathu - yes, a woman! I would not have believed it myself had I not seen her in the fighting pit with my own eyes. Defeated three men at once, and killed one of them. Unfortunate, that - the one she killed was a son of Great Lord Lurmsakun, and so now you may find her among the prisoners, awaiting a painful death… unless you, Commander, can intercede. Such a pity, to waste such strength."),

("umbar_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "So, the people here fancy themselves heirs of greatness, do they? Can anyone here stand proof of such claims?"),
("umbar_guildmaster_companion_none", "You come at the wrong time, Commander. Now we’re all basking in the glory of capturing this holding, and working out the equitable distribution of its wealth - to put it another way, the captains are all at one another’s throats, heated words are being said, and it will not be long ere blood of Umbar is spilled by Umbar hands. Some of the sailors are unhappy, and may consent to follow you instead of their former captains. That’s the best I can do for you at the moment, Commander."),
("umbar_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "Disappointing. But not unexpected of sea-dogs. I shall have to look elsewhere for the quality I seek."),
("umbar_guildmaster_player_found_ok", "A corsair with a code of honour! Not unheard of, but not often found. I care only that he will go where I command, and kill as I instruct."),

("umbar_main_guildmaster_companion", "Why, if I guess aright you seek the finest fighters among us to join your ranks. After the recent burning of our Haven, I’m afraid our best sailors and raiders follow only our most experienced captains. But I have a friend, named Fuldimir, who has been passed over for promotion too many times, to my mind. It’s that strange way of thinking he has - he will not steal, he says, from any who still draw breath. Where’s the sense in that, I ask you? Still, he is handy with a cutlass, and as tough as any hardy seafarer. Here he is, in this tent - you may speak with him."),


("mordor_guildmaster_companion_player_ask", "So, these are the finest in the Black Land, are they? Not much to look at. Tell me who’s actually useful in a scrap."),
("mordor_guildmaster_companion_none", "O ho, a mighty champion is here, I see! And of course, the mighty champion wants only the very best fighters, and no mistake! Well, well! Maybe you’ll find that some of the lads here have plans of their own, to rise high in the sight of the Eye. Maybe you’ll find Lugbúrz thinks a little better of them than of you. Won’t surprise me, ha! Why don’t you just go along to the barracks and requisition your troops like everyone else."),
("mordor_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "Oh, I’ll remember this slight, mark my words. Do me a good turn, and I’ll not forget it, but speak uncivilly to me, and you’ll soon see what I can do about that."),

("mordor_morgul_guildmaster_companion", "You’ll want an Uruk for that, mark my words. The best fighters for sure in this sorry-looking lot. Now, if you’re looking for a trusty lad to watch your back in a fight, I’ll tell you straight: you’ll not find better than old Gorbag. Used to be a comrade of mine, before I got assigned here, a while after the Great Signal went up. Now that he’s off the patrol lists, he could join up with you right enough. He ought to be up there somewhere, by that big ruined Tower where the Bosses meet to talk sometimes. Looking down at the rest of these dunghill rats - he likes to do that, he does, ha!"),

("harad_guildmaster_companion_none", "It is not accordant to our creed for our greatest to join with such as thee, O Commander. In the world, there are the great and the small; for soldiers such as ourselves, always we stand in this relation to one another. I counsel you to seek out those who could learn from you in battle; it is better not to try yoking a mighty stallion to a weakly-made plow, for the stallion would then destroy the plow, to the detriment of all."),
("harad_guildmaster_companion_player_none_ok", "If I understand you correctly, you’ve just disrespected me. I’ll remember this."),

("harad_main_guildmaster_companion", " I heard a story around the fires: when the Black Serpent called his bannermen, who are some of our finest horse archers, many boasted of how all the treasures of the West would soon be theirs; but one whom we call Lykyada stood apart and remained silent. And when they asked him what he hoped to take from the West, he stooped, scooped up a handful of sand, and said, “What do I require that the land of my birth has not already given me? Behold, I make a gift to them of the sand on which I have stood.” And so saying, he let the wind from the east blow the sand away, into the west. Then all who heard this repented of their injudicious words, and swore to follow his lead. If he finds you worthy, Commander, he may follow yours. Look for him where he stands in attendance upon our chieftains."),

#Rohan Horburg Companion added down here for savegame compat.
("rohan_hornburg_guildmaster_companion", "All here at the Hornburg have their given duties, Commander - all save one, I should say. Maybe that one will ride out with you, for otherwise he should be lucky if another Éored will consent to have him! A drunken sot is our Ulfas - good cheer he brings to his comrades, and he is a skilled Rider, but loth is he to set down a tankard without first draining it! Look for him in the hall yonder, if that does not trouble you."),

Man and Elf alike, we who have come here do not hope to return. From the Last Homely House we have come; from the vales and forests of Eriador the last of the Núnatani, whom you call Dúnedain, have come.

Cause the enemy no end of grief, he will, and no mistake! ‘Ere, pipe down, lads! What’re you laughing about? Go on about your rounds, you maggots! Sorry about that, Commander, these louts are an undisciplined lot. Not like Ufthak! Take him along, Commander, you won’t regret it. You can trust Ufthak with your very life.
