# to generate new skybox textures with hdr option:
# hdr images are required to generate our RGBE coded skybox images


# To add a skybox, you should first edit this file and put new skyboxes.txt file into the "Data/" folder of your module. 
# The first "mesh_name" parameter is the name of the skybox mesh to be used for that entry. 
# You can check our meshes from the "skyboxes.brf" file with OpenBRF and copy them, 
# just replace the material's textures with yours. And you will also have to change the 
# specular color parameters for correct hdr rendering. of course specular color does not 
# corresponds to specular lighting, those parameters are used as compression values 
# for RGBE decoding and should be generated while you generate RGBE textures. 
# (specular.red = Scale component, specular.green = Bias component) 
# You can check our materials for the instances of this usage. 
#
# For skybox textures, we are using uncompressed *.hdr files to generate *_rgb.dds and *_exp.dds files. 
# its just a RGBE encoding of the skybox for hdr lighting. here is an example: 
# "skybox.dds" -> simple non-hdr (LDR) image, used when you dont use hdr (DXT1 format is good)
# "skybox_rgb.dds" -> RGB components of the HDR image (DXT1 format is preffered)
# "skybox_exp.dds" -> E (exponent) component of the HDR image (L16 format is good, you can use half resolution for this texture)
# We are using our own command line tool to generete those files from "skybox.hdr" image. 
# But you can generate them with some of the hdr-image editors too. The images should be gamma corrected and should not have mipmaps. 
# You can use Photoshop with DDS plug-ins or DirectX Texture Viewer to see the contents of our dds images.
